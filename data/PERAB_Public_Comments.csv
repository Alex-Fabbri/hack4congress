,Shirleen J Vonhoffmann,HOMEBUILDER'S EDGE,Business,,"Rates Hit Record Lows:  Now we need Loans By Shirleen Von Hoffmann, President Home Builders Edge and Vortex Sales Solutions Copyright 2011 Mortgage rates hit record lows this week, Freddie Mac's chief economist said Thursday.  Rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 4. 12% for the week ending Sept. 8, down from 4. 22% last week and 4. 35% a year ago. The mortgage's previous low was set the week ended Aug. 18, when the rate averaged 4. 15%.   Mortgage rates haven't been above 6% since November 2008, according to Bankrate. com. When the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 6. 33%, a $200,000 mortgage would have had a monthly payment of $1,241. 86. A mortgage rate of 4. 35% on the same size loan would mean a monthly payment of $995. 62.  If we want to stimulate the economy, leaders need to figure out a way to utilize these lower rates.  If we could refinance those who own homes at these low rates, it would keep money moving and slow the foreclosure bleed.  Most Americans would like to refinance now and take advantage of the lower rates but cannot due to little or no value in their homes.  Most of this has occurred due to the huge market drop we have all experienced throughout the country.   A homeowner has to go through hoops, let their payment fall behind in order to get a loan modification and usually ends up with a higher mortgage in the end.  If you want to refinance your mortgage you must have equity of at least 20% to do so.  That kind of equity is non-existent in 70% of our country.  Yes, lenders would take losses on the previous note values they own, however, they can write off those losses and it's certainly better than a foreclosure loss.  No one wins in a foreclosure loss, not the homeowner or the lender.  But what if the primary lender could perform a rate reduction refinance, no cash out, for those who are making their payments on time?  You know, reward good behavior!  It would start a huge stream of refinances, and keep people in homes.  It would also get money moving in our country and create jobs.  If people can lower their payments, it will keep them in their homes, get them spending again and move us out of this recession.  The alternative is people feeling trapped by their higher rates and higher mortgage balances, as they watch their neighbors who are walking away from their homes and say, ""Well, why don't we do it too, we will never get caught up with what we owe, what do we have to lose. ""   We must figure out a way to reward those who are doing the right thing and staying in their homes and making their payments on time or this economy may never get back to a norm.  Our government can move mountains and if our leaders can figure out a way to let the primary lenders allow rate reduction refinances without the current value requirements for refinances, we might just be able to save this country !

,L Berrish,,,,"I am writing regarding recent articles in the Atlanta Journal Constitution about the President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness and the need for engineering students, in particular, American engineering students.  After reading both the Associated Press article and the article by guest columnist Paul Otellini, I was beyond outraged.    My family and I are hard-working middle-class Americans; both my husband and I are college educated.  Our daughter graduated from high school in the top 2% of her class and was accepted for admission to all 8 schools to which she applied.  In May, 2008 she graduated with honors with a Bachelor of Science degree in Physics and a Minor in Mathematics with plans of becoming a mechanical engineer.  She was also an NCAA Division 1 varsity athlete.  Given the economic downturn at the time of her graduation, she decided to go on and obtain her master's degree.  In December, 2010 she graduated with a Master's Degree in Mechanical Engineering from one of the top 10 engineering schools in this country.  She worked long and hard to attain these goals and I am proud of her accomplishments.  Because she was paying for her education herself through student loans, it was important that she use her summer breaks to earn as much money as possible and to do that, she did not take an internship (due to little or no pay) but relied on her athletic background for summer work to earn money for school.  She was certain that with such outstanding educational credentials from 2 fine universities, she would be able to secure an entry level position in her field.  Unfortunately, as of this writing, she has not had one single company respond to her resume for a job!  She used all of the services and resources available to her at the career center at Georgia Tech and even used the little money she had left to have a professional resume writing group help design a great resume for her with all the ""right information"" and still nothing has happened.    Her father and I are livid - here is an extremely intelligent, bright, well-educated, eager young woman just looking for a start in the field of mechanical engineering and no one is willing to give her a chance.  And you have the audacity to write about the need for engineering students - they are already out there.   Is it because she did not do an internship?  Well, not everyone is financially able to do that yet there is no consideration given to those graduates.  So many HR departments today run resumes through an electronic screening program searching for just the right key words that they are missing out on outstanding candidates like my daughter.   The President's council obviously doesn't have a clue what is really happening for our young graduates today.   ",

,Lillian Fuentes,Housing  and Social issues,Non-Profit Organization,,"I write this as a follow up to the President's speech.  I have never been a pessimist and I am keenly aware that this is not the hour to become complacent either through negativity or apathy (which is far worse), but I believe that the Republicans of both the House and the Senate will not allow most of the President's proposed plans to go forth.  I'd like to think that there is hope for the President's ""Project Rebuild"" which is actually multiple funding of  NSPs  (this would mean future job security for me, personally, since I work for a non-for-profit involved in NSP 1,2 and 3)  but I do not believe that this will happen.  In essence, the REPUBLICAN agenda is one of de-regulation - it reminds me of History and Economy classes  on laissez-faire, when the experts in economics were absolutely sure that this was the best for economics -- create an environment in which all transactions were to be free of government intervention, and regulation, and thus, our economic woes will just simply adjust and heal themselves!!!    While  I cannot imagine that the pendulum would ever swing that far,  (and this seems now so simplistic!)    I  know that history tends, unfortunately and depressingly --  to repeat itself so many times over!    As an added element of the Republican agenda for de-regulation campaign, Republicans have been advocating to simplify the tax codes wherein it would effectively reduce taxes to businesses (this, in their mind will mean job creation  because businesses will want to expand and hire more people)   - that is at the center of their ""job creation"" strategy, and of course, they want to cut spending by cutting so many social programs they see as the ""evil"" that has caused such budget imbalances. With this in mind I do not believe they will allow these new spending plans.   While risking again to sound overly simplistic,   I think that the only hope is to combine the two politically-opposed concepts, and marry them into de-regulating and or offering tax-breaks to business that invest in green and sustainable technologies, affordable housing, endowment, hiring of impacted classes of workers (whether they be veterans, disabled, chronically unemployed, etc) and/or that actively fund  their communities' social needs - these businesses should get added tax breaks similar in nature to the tax credits in affordable housing, which I believe to be one of the most successful ""experiments"" in the affordable housing arena.  Instead of moving away from these tax incentives we must embrace them.   The President's agenda includes taxing corporations and getting rid of loopholes, the Republicans instead believe that less regulation and less taxes will incentivize the ""giants"" into caring for their less fortunate fellow brethren.  I think these two diametrically opposed thoughts must come together or the bickering and grandstanding will not end, and government will continue to spin its wheels without accomplishing change.    While I believe that it is a fallacy to believe that removing barriers to corporations will allow the private sector to then create real jobs, I fear that the current mindset of the majority in power will not allow any additional stimulus from the government or once any stimulus is passed, it will be  so weakened and washed down that it will not have the much-needed impact on the current economic woes of our Country.     I guess I am one that would have liked to think the speech to have had a positive effect, but I am left with the belief that there was nothing in it that would have changed the minds of those entrenched in cutting spending and government de-regulation. Instead, I think that heels are more deeply dug. Thank you.  ",

THE  PERCENTAGES I HAVE MENTIONED SHOULD COVER THE BUDGET FOR THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR. IF NOT THEY WOULD HAVE TO BE RAISED TO MEET AT LEAST A LARGE PORTION OF THE BUDGET. i. e. START OUT REFORM WITH A BALANCED BUDGET WHICH WOULD BE IDEALISTIC.

NOTE: WITH A 10% SALES   TAX COMBINED WITH A 10%-15% FLAT TAX-THE GOVERNMENT WOULD BE ABLE TO PICK UP ILLEGAL AND HIDDEN MONEY TAXES AS IT IS SPENT.    NOTE:WE CAN'T WAIT 5-10 YEARS TO BALANCE THE BUDGET. BY THAT TIME THE INTEREST WILL BE 30 OR 40% OF THE BUDGET. WE NEED TO ACT NOW.

BY STARTING A NEW TAX PROGRAM- YOU CAN DISGUISE MANY OF THE TAXES AS REDUCTIONS INSTEAD OF IN MANY CASES AN INCREASE. i. e. THERE IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE SOME INCREASE TO GET A HANDLE ON THE DEBT.       I BELIEVE MY PROPOSALS  ARE MORE REALISTIC -FAIR AND SIMPLER TO UNDERSTAND  THAN WHAT I HAVE SEEN FLOATING AROUND ON THE POLITICAL SCENE FOR THE PAST 30 OR 40 YEARS.   THE ESTATE TAX SHOULD BE A FAIR EXEMPTION AND RATE OR MAYBE JUST A 10% FLAT TAX ON ENTIRE ESTATE. MAJOR ATTENTION WOULD BE GIVEN TO OFFSHORE US HOLDING CORPORATIONS AS WELL AS COMPANIES MOVING BUSINESSES OVERSEAS (OFF SHORE). COMPANIES MOVING OFF SHORE SHOULD BE TREATED AS A FOREIGN CORP. THE US TRADE BALANCE SHOULD BE A PART OF TAX REFORM. EQUAL TARIFFS AND IMPORT/EXPORT QUOTAS SHOULD MATCH. i. e. FAIR TRADE NOT FREE TRADE AS IT IS ABUSED TODAY BY OUR SO CALLED FRIENDS.

I believe I can help with the US situation as sustainable job creation is one of the basis' of my concept and in the US it is an easier fix in my scenario in the uS than in Manila or Port Au Prince.   As you will see by my website, I am a visual person and my paintings and drawing style has always been a patterning of a multitude of strokes/marks, which each do have their own part of the whole. Part of it is also that my mind enjoys seeing the minutia of things and visual patterns.   When I say that I have had a hobby for years of physics and mathematics, it is not only the formulas and number theory and number patterns and sequences which stimulate my mind - also the plots of the formulas and series. - When I look at the Reimann Zeta function, I see the 3D plots and the 2D p-lots and I have a comfortable feeling with it, but when I see the infinite series, I also see a synesthsiastic expression that is visual and when I break the series down by perturbation again it takes on a new visual flaour and likewise my emotional images of the various scenes from Mexican, Indian, Chinese, philipine villages, slums, cities and farms is a series of patterns of human power, horrors/problems, which do repeat in series which again create visual patterns/plots, which can be then be seen as mathematical functions.   Dirac is another favorite of mine, although not involved here, but his formula when looked at comparatively and then translated to quantum symmetries and incredible visual symetries and anti-particles, which can be seen in the quad matrices which again go between number/plot and pattern.   So my Thesis on the Socio-Cultural-economic issues of Humans today is more of a 3D/video documentary or at the minimum a paper with a number of visual and mathematical devices integrated into the presentation/thesis paper. My technical skills, which are both digital and traditional, will allow me to describe my strategies visually,  using 3D and 2D methods and I believe that the two could produce a decent Master's thesis which could help society. I have already started to do some basic 3D beginnings in Blender, which is an Open Source 3D software, which I have been training on this summer, in order to transfer my 3Dmax, Maya training into Open Source tools that I can afford (free).   As I said in my earlier letter, I feel strong enough about the poverty problem that I would even do my Masters in Haiti - although UBC or Columbia University or Harvard would be better, but I would accept the challenge.   I could explain my job creation concept in 15-20 minutes with a white board and there might be a way for me to present it via e-conference or pre-recorded presentation from a studio at Emily Carr University of Art and Design, ECUAD, where I recently finished my BFA.   In return, if yourself/ves feel that my approach could be both helpful to society and Novel, I would ask that I be recommended for a Master's program with scholarship.     Regardless,  I do want to help and I have some novel ideas regarding sustainable Job Creation strategies AND ways to convinve the . 001% to help make them happen. :).

When you were in Bolivia in the 80s, I was taking my first camping trips to Mexico and in the 90s, while you were in Russia and Poland, I was camping in China for 4 months and later in India for 6 months. In the late 90s and 2000s I was married into the Philippine Oligarchy at the Presidential level for 8 years and it was at this time that I really got to understand better why, things have gotten worse for the lower 40% of these countries in the past 20 years.   I am writing because I still see a few very key issues which are missing in the Middle Income countries and I read the environmental data and the Millenium Group reports and I have seen very first hand what is going on in these countries - at this point Dr. Sachs, considering the shear magnitude of the amount of effluents entering our land ,air and oceans, it is plausable that by mid-century, the ongoing changes could cause a sudden environmental paradigm shift in our world's oceans. This Global Warming issue, which is there and does effect the oceans in the Carbon uptake and temperature, raely ever mentions the billions of tons of effluent entering the drink. I have seen many rivers as polluted as the Manila river etc. and when you multiply it out and add 30-40 more years of increased addition, then the oceans which apparently produce 50% of our oxygen - could change Ph or simply succumb due to eco-food-chain breakdown or the entrance of eco-changing substances, such as what happened in the 90s with the dissapperance of the Vultures in India.   We have and still are creating so many ""X-Factors"" that can tip the ecological balance faster than it can adjust by natural selection and mutation.   The key for me Dr. Sachs is the Socio-Cultural aspects of the mix, which are rarely considered and which are still not considered at all in the Middle Income Nations.   I want to do a Master's Degree in Sociology. I am 47 years old and I am an Artist and was actually doing well as a Detailer in Construction in Vancouver while doing my BFA and unfortunatley, I was diagnosed with Late-onset FSH Muscular Dystrophy in 2007 and I now have to re-adjust and my past 25 years has been almost haunted by the odd horrors I saw in Mexico, China and India and I have never stopped being involved. In 2003-2004 I started a company which patented my invention Mechanical Soil US Patent 6,779,299 and during these years I did much research and even wrote to you abiout the DDT thing and you corrected me about the fact that the nets were and still are saving lives.   The bottom line Sir, is that I want to help and I do have some clear ideas of how to still use the ideas of Neo-liberall economics and a Free Market Economy system and simply adjust it into an Ethical-Free-Market Economy as opposed to the Ethics-Free-Market Economies which pervade the planet and really, probably always had before the 20th century. Certainly looking at the Periplus of the Eurythean Sea, one sees that there has been Free Market Economics for millenia, but I do also think that the new economics of the 20th and 21st century has improved the world, BUT, I see more to do.   I am even willing to start in haiti - although I would rather choose India, China or the Philipines - I think Haiti has the strongest example of what I am wantiung to help, especially with their Restavec system, which is another level from buying/renting slaves from the Tondo and Baseco slum in Manila. and it bothers me to see that they are ""rebuilding"" Haiti back into the horror show that it has been sice way before Baby Doc Duvalier and the Ton Ton Macoute and still today the gans are just as scary and the landowners and major business owners are the same - so I want to ""re-build"" them Dr. Sachs!!!!!. :):):)  I want to help find a solution and I have been designing a mathematical analogy to a partial solution/analysis tool,  based on my love for the mathematics, which is a hobby but in my readings of Ramanujan, Cantor and Euler, I feel that I can make a case that may help places like Mexico, Haiti and elsewhere re-adjust their Free Market system in a Win-Win fashion.   I very much respect what you have done and after seeing part two of the series tonight I do understand better how difficult a job the Russia, Ploand and Bolivian cases were.   So I am working on doing my GRE exam in January and I have almost finished writing a 50 page thesis/mini-book on my correlation between mathematical patterns and corruption/poverty and I hope that it will help me get a scholarship and get into a Master's program, which is the best mentoring and learning environment for me to properly author and polish my thesis. I have three sons: Elijah 13, Teagan 12 and Zephyr 7, who live with me 30% of the time and they were recently in Manila for two months and they met ex-President Estrada, who I had met and done a portrait for (with his mother) in 98, the year before the EDSA II march. My kids may be running their grand dad's factories (Oxford printing and Paper Manufacturing one day in Manila and I would like to see a better Manila/Philipines for them to visit, where they don't need guards and I don't have to worry about them getting kidnapped as one of their uncles has been in the past.   . so that is big motivation for me to want to change the world to help those 40%+, whose lives have gotten worse in the past 30 years, while their countries got to another level economically, which I understand was necessary - the problem now Dr. Sachs, is that there is nothing making the top 60% want to adjust their profit margins and that is my goal, to convince them to let the other 40% into a life of Dignity in the form of security, recreation, health care and upwards mobility in their society. without alienating the upper 60%. and especially the top . 001%, who are generally the majority shareholders of the country's power and economy through land and business monopolies and inter-generational dynasties, which remain as each tyrant goes (the philipines is a good example or Hait, wher the Duvaliers and others still are there.   - these are the true guys/gals I am aiming for in my paper/theory, - and re-infusing their profits/money/paying tax into the economy is only a part of it, which is where the mathematics and human element of the picture comes in and it is why I think I can help society as a Sociologist -  - and what I see repeatedly, is that  the new infrastructure is stolen, never installed, in dis-repair and/or is used down the line by the local gangs/officials  to further enslave the end-users and I want to change that in a win-win manner.

I believe I can help with the US situation as sustainable job creation is one of the basis' of my concept and in the US it is an easier fix in my scenario in the uS than in Manila or Port Au Prince.   As you will see by my website, I am a visual person and my paintings and drawing style has always been a patterning of a multitude of strokes/marks, which each do have their own part of the whole. Part of it is also that my mind enjoys seeing the minutia of things and visual patterns.   When I say that I have had a hobby for years of physics and mathematics, it is not only the formulas and number theory and number patterns and sequences which stimulate my mind - also the plots of the formulas and series. - When I look at the Reimann Zeta function, I see the 3D plots and the 2D p-lots and I have a comfortable feeling with it, but when I see the infinite series, I also see a synesthsiastic expression that is visual and when I break the series down by perturbation again it takes on a new visual flaour and likewise my emotional images of the various scenes from Mexican, Indian, Chinese, philipine villages, slums, cities and farms is a series of patterns of human power, horrors/problems, which do repeat in series which again create visual patterns/plots, which can be then be seen as mathematical functions.   Dirac is another favorite of mine, although not involved here, but his formula when looked at comparatively and then translated to quantum symmetries and incredible visual symetries and anti-particles, which can be seen in the quad matrices which again go between number/plot and pattern.   So my Thesis on the Socio-Cultural-economic issues of Humans today is more of a 3D/video documentary or at the minimum a paper with a number of visual and mathematical devices integrated into the presentation/thesis paper. My technical skills, which are both digital and traditional, will allow me to describe my strategies visually,  using 3D and 2D methods and I believe that the two could produce a decent Master's thesis which could help society. I have already started to do some basic 3D beginnings in Blender, which is an Open Source 3D software, which I have been training on this summer, in order to transfer my 3Dmax, Maya training into Open Source tools that I can afford (free).   As I said in my earlier letter, I feel strong enough about the poverty problem that I would even do my Masters in Haiti - although UBC or Columbia University or Harvard would be better, but I would accept the challenge.   I could explain my job creation concept in 15-20 minutes with a white board and there might be a way for me to present it via e-conference or pre-recorded presentation from a studio at Emily Carr University of Art and Design, ECUAD, where I recently finished my BFA.   In return, if yourself/ves feel that my approach could be both helpful to society and Novel, I would ask that I be recommended for a Master's program with scholarship.     Regardless,  I do want to help and I have some novel ideas regarding sustainable Job Creation strategies AND ways to convinve the . 001% to help make them happen. :).   Kind regards,  Tim Clarke.  604-727-7953 https://sites. google. com/site/timothyclarkeartwork/      ---------- Forwarded message ---------- From: Tim Clarke  Date: Mon, Sep 12, 2011 at 2:53 AM Subject: regarding sustainable, top-to-bottom economics and civil society To: sachs@columbia. edu   https://sites. google. com/site/timothyclarkeartwork/  Dear Dr. Sachs,  My name is Tim Clarke and I just finished watching the series Commanding Heights and I wanted to mention that I am also trying to help the world and I am trying to find sources to do a Masters in Sociology.   When you were in Bolivia in the 80s, I was taking my first camping trips to Mexico and in the 90s, while you were in Russia and Poland, I was camping in China for 4 months and later in India for 6 months. In the late 90s and 2000s I was married into the Philippine Oligarchy at the Presidential level for 8 years and it was at this time that I really got to understand better why, things have gotten worse for the lower 40% of these countries in the past 20 years.   I am writing because I still see a few very key issues which are missing in the Middle Income countries and I read the environmental data and the Millenium Group reports and I have seen very first hand what is going on in these countries - at this point Dr. Sachs, considering the shear magnitude of the amount of effluents entering our land ,air and oceans, it is plausable that by mid-century, the ongoing changes could cause a sudden environmental paradigm shift in our world's oceans. This Global Warming issue, which is there and does effect the oceans in the Carbon uptake and temperature, raely ever mentions the billions of tons of effluent entering the drink. I have seen many rivers as polluted as the Manila river etc. and when you multiply it out and add 30-40 more years of increased addition, then the oceans which apparently produce 50% of our oxygen - could change Ph or simply succumb due to eco-food-chain breakdown or the entrance of eco-changing substances, such as what happened in the 90s with the dissapperance of the Vultures in India.   We have and still are creating so many ""X-Factors"" that can tip the ecological balance faster than it can adjust by natural selection and mutation.   The key for me Dr. Sachs is the Socio-Cultural aspects of the mix, which are rarely considered and which are still not considered at all in the Middle Income Nations.   I want to do a Master's Degree in Sociology. I am 47 years old and I am an Artist and was actually doing well as a Detailer in Construction in Vancouver while doing my BFA and unfortunatley, I was diagnosed with Late-onset FSH Muscular Dystrophy in 2007 and I now have to re-adjust and my past 25 years has been almost haunted by the odd horrors I saw in Mexico, China and India and I have never stopped being involved. In 2003-2004 I started a company which patented my invention Mechanical Soil US Patent 6,779,299 and during these years I did much research and even wrote to you abiout the DDT thing and you corrected me about the fact that the nets were and still are saving lives.   The bottom line Sir, is that I want to help and I do have some clear ideas of how to still use the ideas of Neo-liberall economics and a Free Market Economy system and simply adjust it into an Ethical-Free-Market Economy as opposed to the Ethics-Free-Market Economies which pervade the planet and really, probably always had before the 20th century. Certainly looking at the Periplus of the Eurythean Sea, one sees that there has been Free Market Economics for millenia, but I do also think that the new economics of the 20th and 21st century has improved the world, BUT, I see more to do.   I am even willing to start in haiti - although I would rather choose India, China or the Philipines - I think Haiti has the strongest example of what I am wantiung to help, especially with their Restavec system, which is another level from buying/renting slaves from the Tondo and Baseco slum in Manila. and it bothers me to see that they are ""rebuilding"" Haiti back into the horror show that it has been sice way before Baby Doc Duvalier and the Ton Ton Macoute and still today the gans are just as scary and the landowners and major business owners are the same - so I want to ""re-build"" them Dr. Sachs!!!!!. :):):)  I want to help find a solution and I have been designing a mathematical analogy to a partial solution/analysis tool,  based on my love for the mathematics, which is a hobby but in my readings of Ramanujan, Cantor and Euler, I feel that I can make a case that may help places like Mexico, Haiti and elsewhere re-adjust their Free Market system in a Win-Win fashion.   I very much respect what you have done and after seeing part two of the series tonight I do understand better how difficult a job the Russia, Ploand and Bolivian cases were.   So I am working on doing my GRE exam in January and I have almost finished writing a 50 page thesis/mini-book on my correlation between mathematical patterns and corruption/poverty and I hope that it will help me get a scholarship and get into a Master's program, which is the best mentoring and learning environment for me to properly author and polish my thesis. I have three sons: Elijah 13, Teagan 12 and Zephyr 7, who live with me 30% of the time and they were recently in Manila for two months and they met ex-President Estrada, who I had met and done a portrait for (with his mother) in 98, the year before the EDSA II march. My kids may be running their grand dad's factories (Oxford printing and Paper Manufacturing one day in Manila and I would like to see a better Manila/Philipines for them to visit, where they don't need guards and I don't have to worry about them getting kidnapped as one of their uncles has been in the past.   . so that is big motivation for me to want to change the world to help those 40%+, whose lives have gotten worse in the past 30 years, while their countries got to another level economically, which I understand was necessary - the problem now Dr. Sachs, is that there is nothing making the top 60% want to adjust their profit margins and that is my goal, to convince them to let the other 40% into a life of Dignity in the form of security, recreation, health care and upwards mobility in their society. without alienating the upper 60%. and especially the top . 001%, who are generally the majority shareholders of the country's power and economy through land and business monopolies and inter-generational dynasties, which remain as each tyrant goes (the philipines is a good example or Hait, wher the Duvaliers and others still are there.   - these are the true guys/gals I am aiming for in my paper/theory, - and re-infusing their profits/money/paying tax into the economy is only a part of it, which is where the mathematics and human element of the picture comes in and it is why I think I can help society as a Sociologist -  - and what I see repeatedly, is that  the new infrastructure is stolen, never installed, in dis-repair and/or is used down the line by the local gangs/officials  to further enslave the end-users and I want to change that in a win-win manner.

,Michael Britt,Self,Other,,How do you pull together a group to discuss plans to make American more competitve and put Americans back to work and not include the personal experiences of the unemployed? I will submit my resume and a cover letter to the appropriate staff because I don't intend to have my resume circulated in the Washington Post or NY Times. ,
,Carlton Buford,Williams,Business,,"Where are your repepresntative on this task force from Oil, natural Gas and Coal, large investor owned electric utilities.   I have read this council's proposal to the president, June, 2013.  these are bandaids.  The US economy needs Structural Surgery.  In the attachment, on three pages i outline the economic theory which describes what America's economic problem is, then provide a solution, tied specifically to America's problem.  That's problem, cause, Solution, derived from problem, not politics.  Why is it that we think strategically and logically when dealing with challenges in the private sector, bet then when it comes to public policy, we just through up the easiest solutions that appease people's biases, rather than strategically, doing a situation analysis, evaluating what we have and what works and using that as the priority to help us to get to whee we are going.  I have the solution and would love to have further discussions with the council on my proposal.  The United State of America is at the fork in the road in terms of our destiny, we have a chance to rebuild and restore our greatness and leadership for ourselves and the world, if we are willing to take the expensive surgery now, rather than putting another bandaid on it, and hoping things will just all work themselves out in the future.  They will work themselve out, but it will be other countries growing and thriving at our expense unless we become ""market makers"" for our own economy and for our own people.  Please provide me an opportunity to extend my proposed ideas into policies and actions that will save our country and at the same time save the global economy. ",
,Cheareen Jones,The work to work foundation,Non-Profit Organization,,"Dear United States Department of Labor (wage and hour division):  The work to work foundation would like to bring to your attention a few concerns that continue to be a great issue in regards to the health and human services of the American worker.   During the hiring process employee entrance packages are not given to new employees.  At hire employees are requested to complete forms related to personal information and background, company policy and procedures, and government rules and regulations.  Employees are not receiving pretty welcome kits when entering an organization.  Employee entrance does not inform the employee on vacations or number of sick days a year.  The work to work foundation will like to instate, in the strictest demand, that employee entrance and exit packages be provided to all employees during the hiring and termination processes.    Included in the employee entrance packages, the work to work foundation will like to make the following requests:      One (1) month/four (4) week employee vacation agreement upon completion of 1st year of employment (payroll deduction options should be given to every employee)     All employee leave options made available during the entrance/intake period     Sixteen (16) sick days a year with rollover (payroll deducted)     A national minimum employment term of 2 years for all permanent employees     Employment History versus Employment Experience         No more 10 year history         Only the relevant experience     All employees provided some form of medical, dental, and vision benefits     Severance agreements made upon hire     Plan for temporary replacements when employees are on leave     More work hour flexibility for working single parents     No more use of the word ""Termination"", ""Terminated"", or ""discharged""  spoken or written.   Two (2) year minimum term toward an indefinite period of employment.  Human Resources is fully educated, certified, and skilled, in the highest professional sense, to screen candidates whom they know would be able to remain employed for at least a two (2) year minimum term with the company.  What is wrong with the hiring process?  What is wrong with the interview?  What is wrong with the screening of candidates? The work to work foundation requests that termination before a two (2) year minimum term be prohibited on the strictest levels. Confidence in Human Resources ability to test, train and screen qualified candidates is certain.     In regards to employment history versus employment experience; the work to work foundation will like to prohibit employers from requesting the job applicant to provide a 10 year employment history.  Only the relevant matters, and an applicants employment history may not entail positions that detail experience in one position.   Experience for the position is important not history.  The work to work foundation will like to prevent Human Resources and all companies from extracting the citizens employment history.  And, we are prepared to handle this matter as though a breach of an employees confidentiality and privacy, in symbolism of medical records, has been performed.   The work to work foundation requests new forms created and new employment forms distributed to all employees during hire.  We request these forms to be a mandate of each state and of the United States Department of Labor.   Sincerely,  Cheareen Jones The work to work foundation 973-634-5184 ",

,Meredith Ray,taxpayer,Individual,,"Suggestion for job creation coupled with welfare and poverty reduction:  All Federal, State and Local Government ENTRY LEVEL jobs (clerical, custodial, agricultural, etc) should go to people on welfare or living below the poverty level. It would take them immediately off all the various welfare rolls, as it would raise them over the poverty line, as well as be on on-the-job training program. After a period of time, perhaps a year, either they are then qualified to be promoted within the system, or they have to leave, but not return to the welfare roles, as they should have enough experience to get a private industry job.

,Edward Sample,None,,,"My name is Edward Sample.  I am a Disabled American.  My degree is in Electronics Engineering Technology (DeVry University, Chicago, Ill. - 1988).  My work experience is that of a Computer Technician.  I have over 25 years of verifiable career and work related experience in the field of Information Technology.  I have included a cover letter, as well as a resume for your review.   My reason for writing you is due to the recent Federal Aviation Administration's situation of the various employees who are working long and hard hours, being over-worked, sleeping on the job, or not giving their full attention to their immediate tasks and duties.   As you are well aware, Air Traffic Controllers (ATC) are faced with multi-faceted responsibilities.  Whether they are in the Control Tower, or in the terminal radar approach control (TRACON) room or building.  During extremely busy times, controllers are expected to work quickly, effectively and efficiently.  Total concentration is required to keep track of several planes at the same time, and to make certain that all pilots receive the most accurate and detailed of instructions.  The stress of being responsible for the safety of several aircraft and their passengers can be a task most daunting and vastly overwhelmingly exhausting.  Not only physically, but emotionally and mentally as well.   Unlike tower controllers, radar controllers also have the extra stress of having to work in semi-darkness, never seeing the actual aircraft they control, except as a small ""blip"" on the radarscope.  Even though ATCs are required to have highly specialized skills, controllers apply separation rules to keep aircraft apart from each other in their area of responsibility, and move all aircraft safely and efficiently through their assigned sector of airspace.  Because controllers have an incredibly large responsibility while on duty, the ATC's profession is regarded around the world as one of the most difficult jobs today, and can be notoriously stressful, depending on the many variables (equipment, configurations, weather, traffic volume, human factors, etc. ).  This, I am certain, you can imagine how the stress levels can wildly fluctuate.   A POSSIBLE SOLUTION:  With this scenario being active in various parts of the USA, as well other countries, I am suggesting that to help decrease the stress levels that this profession can cause, a program be created and developed to train or re-train Disabled Americans, and Disabled American Veterans who are currently un-employed and available to accept the responsibility as an assistant to the Federal Aviation Administration's Air Traffic Controllers -- on a part-time basis.  A program of this magnitude can have a three-fold benefit to our nation:   1. } This program would assist in relieving a great portion of the constant stress and tension (physically, mentally and emotionally), that is continuously placed upon our current Air Traffic Controllers.   2. } This type of program could also prove to be beneficial in helping to improve our  nation's employment outlook.   3. } With many of our current Air Traffic Controllers retiring or reaching the level of  retirement, Disabled Americans and Disabled American Veterans can be an extremely useful resource for the selection and education process of training and re-training for future Air Traffic Controllers.   I do understand that we, as a country, are experiencing dire economic times.  However, I also believe that training and re-training us as part-time Air Traffic Controllers is a viable and possible opportunity for our nation, Disabled Americans, and Disabled American Veterans.   I do ask that you would at least take the necessary time and effort to look into the pros and cons of the possibilities of this program.  There may be an even greater number of possibilities and useful benefits.  One such personal benefit is that a program of this magnitude would also help to inspire individuals such as ourselves, who can still be of great service, not only within our communities, but it can also help to continue us to be of service to our great nation.

The Federal Reserve's Monetary Policy (Persue  of Maximum  Employment) appears to have never been activated.   The FED should be able to fund contracts for the purpose of their Monetary Policy and the Federal Reserve Act pertaining to Maximum Employment.   I have offered to help the 5th district Federal Reserve, as to put ALL Unemployed to work.   This would have provided Jobs no only for those counted as Unemployed, but also for those not counted.

,bryan,,,,"To Whom this may concern, I am writing this letter on behalf of myself and all the fellow EMS personnel currently employed in Kuwait. I guess to start off a little about myself. I am a Veteran of the Armed Forces and recently got out of the Army. Just like most people in the United States I was hard pressed to find a job and was collecting unemployment while doing so. I applied to many places only to hear that I was either over qualified or under qualified. Well I located a company that was hiring EMT's to go to Kuwait and support our troops as civilian EMT's. I thought to myself what better job to continue serving my soldiers while no longer being a burden to the US economy and stop needing help through unemployment. Well I applied for the position and was hired. Well here I am working again and doing something worth while. I am currently employed through George Washington University Medical Faculty Associates.  Well after only a few months of being here all the EMT-B's where told that we will be fired and replaced by Philippinos. Well I can see through a company stand point that this will save them money because they can pay them much less then we get paid. When I applied for this job it stated that we must be National Registered EMT's and must have at least two years of experience. We are also required to have a security clearance in order to work on bases in Kuwait.  We have to have a full medical screening by both a Medical Doctor as well as a Dentist. We have to have a clean criminal history and a US drivers license. Well in order for the company to save more money they are hiring  Philippinos to come in and replace us. The company is sending them to school to obtain their National Registry because it is a course that is not taught in their country. After completion of these courses they are being sent over with NO experience to treat American Soldiers on American bases. They are also not able to gain security clearances because they are not US citizens. They do not have to have the same experience as EMT's as we do. With that being said, just imagine a Soldier coming back from Iraq or Afghanistan and is in Kuwait just to die on an American base because inadequate care was given by someone who is only required to have an EMT certificate with NO experience.  I'm asking for your help! The government is always saying that the unemployment rate is at its highest. Well guess where I will be when I am fired? The soldiers here will start to be treated by individuals that have much less experience in Emergency Medicine and are being pushed through school and coming over here with only a few weeks of training. Why is it for an American to work for Americans on American bases to support American Soldiers there is so much required but to save a few bucks companies are tossing out those requirements and are satisfied with it? How can Government money be used to fire Americans to give jobs to other countries but complain there is nothing being done to get Americans jobs and stimulate our country? Not only are the EMS personal being replaced but these companies are also trying to replace all the fire departments here as well. Soon enough these companies will fire ALL Americans to out source to cheaper and less qualified people. So maybe you can help with saving American jobs, keeping the unemployment rate from growing as well as making sure our troops are taken care of by qualified personnel. I Challenge you to help and to take action with these issues. If not for us at least for the troops to make sure they will be adequately taken care of.   Sincerely yours,   EMS Personal in Kuwait",

,"Fred Marshall, PhD","Mission Systems, Inc. ",Other,,"Subject: One way to make jobs.  We know that economics is a ""feedback system"" where one change affects much of everything else.  I'm sure you know how small companies contribute to making jobs. Mr. Immelt has talked about getting government out of the way.  Please consider this: Small businesses can't get business loans - almost no matter how worthy and almost no matter how low-risk they may be.  That limits job creation.   Their bankers are being squeezed by the federal goverment who are raising capital ratios, etc.  It seems unecessary to make the banks presumably ""more stable"" when the real issue all along has been to not encourage making bad loans.  Making ALL loans more difficult is going in the wrong direction. but only if you want to see jobs created. ",
,Rohan Kulkarni,,Other,,"Sep 18, 2011 President Barak Obama    The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Ave, NW Washington, DC 20500  CC: Rep Frank Wolf, Sen Jim Webb, Sen Mark Warner, Speaker John Boehner, Rep Eric Cantor, Sen Harry Reid, Sen Mitch McConnell, Mr. Jeffrey Immelt, Press  Project Simple Reinvention  Mr. President, While I am optimistic about the future, I am tired and frustrated as are millions of Americans about the political futility of the various plans proposed to reduce employment and kick start our economy. I do not believe they will work as neither sides appears to want to work together. So I am proposing to you Project Simple Reinvention; a simple, yet powerful plan that leverages the private sector to do what only the private sector can do. Hire Millions.   This is a simple plan to break the enormous dependency on the government to reduce unemployment. The plan is to empower the private sector to become the driver but in a targeted manner. This targeted and impactful attack on unemployment should not only reduce unemployment to 5% but create a real and sustaining demand for products and services to grow and expand our economy. The framework of the plan is;  1.  Encourage some 195,000 private US companies/employers who have more than 100 employees in America to hire 6 million by October 31, 2011.  2.  While on average each of the employers would need to hire 32 employees, reality is they could hire between 1-50 depending upon their size, industry, community and other criteria. The levels of employment we need by each individual employer would be minuscule compared to their overall size. This will minimize risk and costs to the employers and encouraging them to participate.   3.  This is perhaps the only place we need the government to support it and that is to provide a tax credit per newly hired employee up to 50% of their wages for the first six months or until April 30, 2012. This will help the employers offset some Q4 costs while reducing risk.  4.  Finally, participating employers should commit that they will not eliminate existing positions to make room for new employees hired as part of Project Simple Reinvention for at least 6 months.   The impact of the plan would be so powerful that I envision the following to happen: 1.  It will reduce our unemployment to normal levels while boosting revenues without having to raise taxes in as little as 30 - 60 days.  2.  It will generate demand and reignite ancillary industries from retail, restaurants, cars, travel and tourism.  3.  The timing will be particularly impactful coming in ahead of the holiday season, ensuring more kids this holiday season will be visited by Santa Claus.   While I am convinced that this is the sort of Bazooka we need, to end the vicious business and political cycle we are in, it requires a planned and coordinated strike, one that is unprecedented in nature. Putting 6 million Americans back to work in 30 days across close to 200,000 employers will require leadership, trust and enormous resolve. All of which I believe we have. Please keep government involvement to a minimum and let the private sector do what they can.   Wish you the best and God Bless the United States of America.   Sincerely Rohan Kulkarni http://revrex. blogspot. com/2011/09/driving-job-creation-open-letter-to. html ",
,Angelita Cole,,Individual,,As a individual that has been unemployed for longer then I would like or expected I do have a suggestion to major companies in regards to the hiring process.  Many companies utilize online program to submit information to be considered for employment.  These programs are so limited in the information  that you can be input into the field it makes it difficult for someone with experience in another industry or say a freelance experience and they are trying to enter another industry.  I think that there are jobs out there but its very difficult to match people with similar skills that maybe trying to reinvent themselves and could be of value in another industry.  Please do some online research in regards to programs like taleo.  There are websites that have collected mainly negative responses from both applicants and human resource personnel.  It might be good for organizations that use these types of programs to maybe really take a look at the applications that have been submitted but maybe rejected by the system because pertinent search words did not match.  And have a human actually review the applications.  With so many people unemployed it might be nice to take a month and put humans back into the human resource departments.  Review actual resumes do brief phone interviews and see if some of these applicants really do have skills to offer the organization. I think this comission should reach out to unemployed individuals and hear some of the roadblocks and frustrations in trying to find a job and take this into account to the recommendations of this council. ,

All we lack is your support and the combined action of 4+ million US small business owners (who currently pay average annual salaries of $31K to 40+ million Americans and are ready to expand their payrolls immediately if they had the necessary upfront investment capital to allow their businesses to grow) and at least 4+ million of the 14 million unemployed Americans (who have the necessary job skills and are ready to go to work and spend their salaries in a manner that would jump start the growth of the economy if they had the guarantee of a full-time job).   So, please LIKE the page and ask the small business owners and any unemployed people you know to do the same.   Once we have 4+ million business owners who have agreed to join the cause by saying they would accept a $100,000 Small Business Expansion loan in exchange for hiring at least 1 net new employee to a 3 year contract, then we can launch the mother-of-all-job-fairs online by giving these job creators access to the LinkedIn (or BranchOut) resumes of the 4+ million Americans who've agreed to work for a 3 year contract in exchange for a future garnishment of up to 10% of their future salaries for 20 years or until at least $100,000 has been paid into the Small Business Expansion Fund.   Given that these 4+ million currently unemployed Americans currently pay 0% in US taxes, it is reasonable to believe the US Government will agree to manage the collection of these 10% wage garnishments on behalf of the private investors who provide the initial capital for the Small Business Expansion Fund and to allow these 4+ million newly employed Americans to credit these wage garnishments against their future tax liabilities.   Given that these 4+ million business owners are taking a risk by hiring a new employee to a 3 year contract and borrowing $100,000 in the current economic climate from the Small Business Expansion Fund, it is reasonable to believe the US Government will agree to manage the collection of the 10% per year principle payments on these loans on behalf of the private investors who provide the initial capital for the Small Business Expansion Fund and to allow these 4+ million business owners to credit these loan repayments against their future tax liabilities.

,Earl P Mink,,Retired Federal Employee ( D. O. E). ,Government,"The key to worker training and retraining is a standard description of jobs and associated work activities. You can then identify the knowledge, skills and abilities required to do the work at all levels. The US department of Energy retrained its technical work force using ""Functional Analysis"" in the late 1980s. We found a simple and effective way of describing jobs using a small group of workers in each function to describe the work activities and the skill requirements. We then developed training to provide the skills. Done on a national level, the country could have a directory of jobs with required skills and abilities to help workers change professions and to aid in retraining. The bottom line is that there is an overlap in work skills in many jobs and movement between them would be facilitated.  Industry, unions and governments could all participate in the project. It would be non political and very low cost! Let me know if I can help. I was manager of the DOE project, E. Paul Mink 301-649-4892",

As past president of three companies myself, I understood why President Bush did not want to sign the Kyoto Accord, as it would be used as a tool to further drive up compliance expenses here and be ignored in most foriegn nations.  We receive absolute junk from China, contaminated drugs, toxic toys and all the while they pollute our globes water and air with impunity.  I suggest that if we can be locked out of a country for one mad cow, now we should consider an environmental non-compliance levy for goods coming from countries that continue to pollute in excess of US standards.  This is the very essence of why many jobs left the US in the first place.  Our country has forced our industries to comply or move off shore.  This is hypocrisy, and the job loss could be reversed if the other nations were forced to comply to US standards or pay a levy to import to the US.  It would not violate ""Free Trade"" as it is not a duty or tariff, but in fact levels the playing field in an ""Earth Positive"" way. ",

This would allow easier visibility, access of potential customers vehicles and delivery trucks to the many presently empty Commercial & Industrial buildings and their parking facilities fronting on business and industrial zoned now non-accessible roads.
