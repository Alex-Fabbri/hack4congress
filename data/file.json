    "Comment": "I know that one issue in the Gulf of Mexico is the possible overfishing of reef species such as Red Snapper and Grouper. We need more artificial habitat for the fish. Most of the bottom in the Gulf area is sand. Some species thrive but not snapper and grouper. in the panhandle area of Florida we need a great deal more artificial structure to allow the reef fish species populations to rebound. Now there are very few natural and artificial habitats in less than 250 ft depth. Since there are so few natural and artificial reefs in the panhandle area of Florida the Commercial Fishermen keep the populations harvested to minimum populations.",

I have extreme concern over the long-standing, horrifically toxic Navy \"weapons training\" programs that are taking place along all our coastlines, threatening not only the fisheries, but also the coastal regions.

No one likes closed areas, but if you provide the public an opportunity to work with resource managers on determining what areas will be closed, you soften the blow. Utilizing GIS in marine spatial planning will greatly enhance the decision making process._x000D_\nThe US has several great outlets of information and community involvement. Bring the marine planning issue to your National Marine Sanctuaries and request greater involvement of their Advisory Councils. You can also request that federal fisheries management councils get involved in marine spatial planning. _x000D_\nOne example of user conflict in marine spatial planning is planning the sites for offshore energy and aquaculture. Marine spatial planners must plan accordingly for the expansion of these industries as they will be essential in rebuilding US economy- they will create jobs, food and energy! _x000D_\nMarine planning and zoning must consider the space requirements for both recreational and commercial activities through public outreach. In addition to focus groups, telephone surveys and other traditional methods of data collection, fishermen and farmers should be able to visit a website and say \u201cI play here\u201d or \u201cI work here.\u201d The validity of information the public provides can be verified by cross referencing state and federal license databases. Collecting geographic information online will allow resource managers to get a better idea about the spatial distribution of existing commercial and recreational activities. At the end of the comment period, the databases for each user- group are compiled, geographic information is averaged, and provided to regional and federal taskforces to determine appropriate zones. Bottom line: use technology to your advantage. _x000D_",

Recreational boating and fishing, in addition to being hugely popular, have an enormous economic impact on the states whose areas are covered by the policy. I would urge you to consider recreational boating and fishing as a equal partner in the list of priorities for the program. Thank you.",

To completely shut down exploration and development will not only hurt Alaska's economy, it will also jeapordize the National Security of America.  We must become less dependent on foreign countries for energy and begin better management of our own energy resources, NOW.",

I mean technically you can't stop them unless they are within a certain range of our coast. They are the biggest threats to fisheries, yet they go unpunished. What scientific fact is being used, the same stellar research used to skew global warming information? It all comes down to money you don;t make enough off the little man so you take away.

    "Comment": "Our water would be cleaner and safer and industrial jobs would come back to the United States if a strong Federal ballast water policy to build our Coast Guard up to the level needed to just inspect and test the problems, those who want to bring goods into our country would encounter.  The Coast Guard could even pick the best ones for our military while implementing a stronger time line, similar to the one Senator Boxer stopped over a year ago because it was not fast enough for her idea of States Rights. The replacement of old ships barges, etc. used exclusively on the Great Lakes could create new industry along with just shoring up the Coast Guards infrastructure. Unfortunately China and the EU, ETC. have already crafted plans to lead international green ship building.  Many of their new ballast water technologies may do more harm than good. Inspection should be the primary concern since on 9/11 we should have realized that we need to change the way we do business in the world, we can no longer afford to wait for countries that do not care what they put in the products they sell us, to care what they dump in our water.  We should not believe they will care about the carbon footprint in their manufacturing either. If international shipping can not keep up with the technology needed to protect our environment  for future generations,  new consumer goods may be produced in our country, with ecological care as new green shipping cost offset development of ecologically responsible manufacturing methods. Negotiations on a world scale with these same people, not wanting to accept verification of carbon emission\u2019s is of no value, and to allow the acceptance of laws and rules developed by the IMO, an organization composed with these same international interest, is also of little value to the worlds environment. The history of invasive species and pathogens has proven  the IMO's ability to fix and police ballast water is close to useless.  Off shore energy exploration and mining, which release new microbes from the ocean would be safer and easier to capitalize on developing green technology to offset energy independence. ",

WITH  POSITIVE  OUTCOMES  FOR   ENVIROMENTAL  GROUPS  SUCH   AS   RECYLING ,  ANTI-POLLUTION  AND   CHEMICAL  WASTE   PROGRAMS  .  I   HAVE ALSO WORKED WITH NON- PROFIT \u2013ORGANIZATIONS,   AND OTHER  SAVE  THE  OCEANS  PROJECTS.  I  HAVE  28  YEARS  EXPERIENCE  IN THE TEXTILE  INDUSTRIAL  FIELD . AND  HAVE   BEEN STUDYING  ENVIROMENTAL  POLLUTION  MATTERS  FOR  A  WHILE INDEPENDENTLY .  I  CAN SEE THE NEGATIVE  AND POSITIVE    RESULTS  THIS  MIGHT  BRING.

    "Comment": "I am pleased to see the geographic scope includes state waters landward to the mean high water line (bottom of page 8).  However, I am disappointed to see that \u201cPrivately owned submerged lands as defined by law would be excluded from the geographic scope\u201d (top of page 9).  In Washington State, under the Bush and Callow Acts passed in 1895, approximately 47,000 acres of tidelands were sold by the state for the specific purpose of farming native oysters.  The laws have subsequently been amended to allow culture of other species.  As a result of these laws Washington is the largest producer of farmed shellfish in the country.  The use of these lands has been jeopardized due to lack of comprehensive planning by state and local governments.  Lack of adequate development, stormwater and sewage regulations has resulted in water quality degradation and user conflicts.  Exponential shoreline development is exacerbating the problem.  The consequence is that many of these lands can no longer be used for their deeded purpose.  These privately owned commercial shellfish tidelands must be included as a defined layer in any marine spatial planning effort and their use protected.   Washington and numerous other states also have state tide and bedlands that have been leased for decades for farming shellfish.  These must be included as well as should areas with good potential for growth of shellfish and other types of marine farming.   For the reasons articulated above, when tidelands or bedlands are privately owned, their location and designated use, whether shellfish farming or otherwise must be included in marine spatial planning efforts. _x000D_\nWe strongly agree, as noted on page 9: \u201cInclusion of inland bays and estuaries is essential because of the significant ecological, social, and economic linkages between these areas with offshore areas.\u201d_x000D_\nWe also concur as noted on page 10 that effective CMSP ultimately depends upon a better integration of coastal planning that considers influences from, and activities within, coastal watersheds and other contributing land areas.  Lack of such planning has jeopardized the water quality in our existing shellfish growing areas._x000D_\n_x000D_\nOn page 15 the Framework calls for the analysis of Data, Uses, Services, and Impacts.  The fourth bullet should be amended to include the relative economic contribution of current and emerging ocean uses. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nFrom a stakeholders perspective, this framework appears very top down.  Stakeholder outreach is included but it comes across as telling the stakeholders what has been decided as opposed to getting their input on what should be included._x000D_",

    "Comment": "Dear President Obama,  I am writing to again to try an explain some of the benefits that you as commander and chief, could direct to help world health, world environment, and jobs for the American economy. Although these changes would be dynamic and may create some temporary sacrifice on the part of the American people, if they understood the problem and danger, I belief they would rise to the challenge and provide a better healthier environment for the country and world. By cleaning our water industrial jobs would come back to the United States,  if a strong Federal ballast water policy to build our Coast Guard up to the level needed to just inspect and test the problems, those who want to bring goods into our country would encounter.  The Coast Guard could even pick the best ones for our military while implementing a stronger time line similar to the one Senator Boxer stopped over a year ago because it was not fast enough for her idea of States Rights. The replacement of old ships barges, etc. used exclusively on the Great Lakes could create new industry along with shoring up the Coast Guards infrastructure and updating industries coastal movements of fossil fuels. Unfortunately China and the EU, ETC. have already crafted plans to lead international green ship building. Inspection should be the primary concern since on 9/11 we should have realized that we need to change the way we do business in the world. We can no longer afford to wait for countries that do not care what they put in the products they sell us, to care what they dump in our water. These inspections should also include the other threats of destruction that could also arrive in our port cities. The Coast guard program for the necessary infrastructure should include integration with the academic world; to create the sciences needed to insure true understanding of the environmental aspects of protecting our water. Veterans\u2019 (disabled ETC.) wishing to continue to serve could also be employed in academic sciences and surveillance. Today\u2019s technology, (of eyes and ears), makes some surveillance of ships, possible from a far.   Many new ballast water technologies may do more harm than good. We should not believe that those who do not care about the carbon footprint in their manufacturing will care about our water if they do not care what they put in our children\u2019s toys or what stolen brand names they copy.  Negotiations on a world scale with these same people, not wanting to accept verification of carbon emissions\u2019 is of no value, and to allow the acceptance of laws and rules developed by the IMO, an organization composed with these same international interest, is also of little value to the worlds environment and health.  To continue trying to develop economic globalization with countries that are the worlds dominate ship builders, while they continue to keep their emissions high and a secret, claiming to be an underdeveloped country, as the wealth is shared by a privileged few is plain wrong.   The history of invasive species and pathogens has proven, the IMO,s ability to fix ballast water and police  themselves is close to useless.  Off shore energy exploration and mining, which release new microbes from the ocean would be safer and easier to capitalize on allowing developing green technology to offset energy independence. If foreign infrastructure in the shipping industry could not keep up to the standards we need to protect our environment, it may make the cost of goods manufactured in our country cheaper, while using stricter environmental standards that create less damage to the worlds environment than those who do not care. It would make more sense for our country to try and develop the continents of the new world economically before considering development of China. In South America real impoverished countries suffering from the affects of global warming such as Bolivia could be developed with our help in ways to develop green manufacturing to fill the void in consumer goods that the US may temporarily incur. This could be done without the huge pollution problems of ship\u2019s crossing the oceans.

This framework and what is developed under it will have major implications for our freshwater and salt water resources long into the future.  The Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Cities Inititive will likely provide more detailed comments at a later date, but we want to bring something to your immediate attention.  On page 11, the framework describes how the NOC will create regional planning bodies made up of Federal, State, and Tribal authorities.  Because of the critical importance of local government authorities, their representatives should also be included.  At various points in the document, local government is referred to with state and tribal governments, but in other places it is not, most importantly as part of the regional planning bodies.  Also, although not discussed in the framework, but referred to in the chart on p. 26, is the \"Governance Advisory Committee.\"  From the September 10, 2009 Interim Report of the Task Froce, the Governance Advisory Committee does not appear to include local government representation.

With the strapped economy each coastal state has I cannot see how they can afford to spend the money to get together and discuss these issues. It would be great to have the agencies work together to reduce the burden and get the permits quicker.  That said, there is significant differences between say USFWS and NMFS especially in the definitions of the measures.  For example: a temporary threshold shift (TTS) for USFWS means harm that could lead to death and the same verbage with NMFS means no significant or long lasting injury, its temporary.  These types of discrepancies will have to be fixed before this is implemented or it won't work.",

It is an attempt to further control the ability of all citizens to pursue life and liberty, whether through commercial access to oceans or simply the responsible enjoyment of the last truly wild frontier on this planet - that is already heavily legislated.  This task force displays the same arrogance in which others of its like intend to control the natural climatological changes of our planet that have been occurring naturally for the last 4.7 billion years - without regard to a true and unbiased scientific process. We are all simply people of this Earth - not God - not even our elected or appointed leaders.

    "Comment": "The Federal government should fix another problem like the Asian carp, which southern fish farmers also pose. Currently the use of natural waters in the transportation of fish is a states rights issue as to how it is disposed of. These waters often contain chemicals, pathogens, and invasive which in many cases end up in our natural waters. (Such as the transportation of bait fish) With ballast water, another state rights issue, huge state spending to protect their people and environment could be eliminated and used as stimulus. The impact that implementation of a strong policy, with a fast time line for cleaned water disposal only, will have on shipping, will change the economic dynamics of world trade and also protect our countries environment and health for future generations. China is the world\u2019s leader in shipping. They will not agree to verify \u201ccarbon emissions\u201d!  Counterfeit our goods!  Add harmful ingredients to our products!     As they are one of the major members of the IMO we can not trust they will care what dump in our water either, or think that they will push to make any significant changes to IMO policy towards  shipping pollution. In 2001 the last time a president officially gave ballast water consideration, only an appeasing gesture to environmentalist was enacted despite fostering and continuing a  policy of economic globalization knowing our waters were being destroyed. Perhaps developing strong manufacturing economies with countries on our border where ballast water is not problematic would provide better security than developing economic relations with communist countries on the other side of the world. _x000D_\nNew technologies required for environmental shipping should cost those wishing to bring goods into our country more money (making American manufacturing cost effective), not those who wish to protect our country from ecological destruction and disease resulting from economic globalization by shipping from economies where the wealth is controlled by the ruling elite. Unfortunately legislation crafted in 2008 by the House of Representatives was not considered by the Senate because of worries that it would over ride the stricter time line of the state of California\u2019s regulations, so now better than a year later we have nothing. The military, (Coast Guard) who is directed by the President (commander and chief) are purposing a couple decades plus plan. With our commander and chief continuing to quietly not address this problem no real change will happen during this president\u2019s term from the Coast Guard current plan even if he is reelected, and can again be delayed by the next commander and chief. It will take a President who cares more about the world\u2019s long term health, environment, American freedom, independence and quality of life, more than the  hobnobbing of economic globalization for our country with foreign economies so our large retail employers can keep their store shelves filled with cheap goods while Americans are out of work.

    "Comment": "Dear Sirs, Unfortunately I noticed that my last post made several days ago was not included in your posting update today. I am concerned it was lost. Since I believe this information has important value that would be useful in protecting our waters from pollution, I will try again to explain the problem. I will be referring to a disk containing a much more detailed analysis of the information, than I will be able to cover here. You should be able to extrapolate more important factual information from the disk sent to Vice president Biden, but since I am not sure he received or still has his copy the former vice president may be able to assist you, because I know he received his, because of his grateful acknowledgement.  As bills like H.R.3669 address the problems of invasive species, it should be noted that fish farmers have had meetings with officials of the Federal government discussing their belief that waters of fish being brought into our country need to be considered for problems. As industry will play an important role in helping keep our waters clean the disk sent to the vice president contains a published copy of meeting minutes along with information on chemical use by these same farmers, problems including interstate transportation with no federal endorsement, disease and invasive are discussed from their business perspective. Now as these problems are discussed from their point of view. It should be noted that not all of their plans may be environmentally sound. They seem to want to be able to move their fish through state lines without considering the quality of water used or what is added, while using an international set of standards regarding testing of the fish only. They also suggest that the state of Maine, who has not allowed importation of bait fish, is a problem that should be remedy and that the state of Arkansas should be considered a disease free zone, along with many other questionable practices. Some of these fish farmers will deliver fish through fed \u2013ex by air to all states. They even have a bait fish that has a patent pending that will live in salt or fresh water. I can only wonder how many of these prototypes were already sold in the US and are now reproducing in the wild or farm ponds. If legislation controlling the import of foreign exotic ornamentals and aquarium fish is crafted to eliminate an invasive problem, it is quite probable that the domestic problems associated transportation of fish across state lines without jurisdiction will dramatically increase, as would domestic production. The transportation of bait fish and ornamentals use non chlorinated natural waters which can contain invasive species, pathogens and chemicals that can and do in many instances end up being disposed of in our natural waters. In 1994 when fish being brought from Arkansas to my business, dying from disease where I used natural spring water, it was not uncommon to see ornamentals, bait fish, fish for the food industry, all on the same truck. I also know that addition of new water to the truck was common as well as spreading fish to tanks already emptied, before they moved on to their next delivery. The water discharged had a sudsy, milky look filled with fish scales Etc. often containing invasive, pollywogs crabs, Etc. The way fish are often released into natural waters for holding is often done with a pipe from truck to tanks integrated with natural waters feeding them as well as accepting their overflow. On the disk you will also see how my state dealt with talk of this virus in water along with how former state officials in your administration failed to consider and address the issue of water in fish transportation. To me it would seem we can not expect to address the problem of pathogens, virus, and invasive in ballast water if our elected officials will not recognize the same problems in other movements of water._x000D_\nThat the same individual that did not respect the quality of water in my state knowing that our state university was given a grant to study virus in water, and is now a part of trade negotiations in your administration. I unfortunately have little faith in your desire to address ballast water. Again these things can be verified an expanded on by viewing a complete copy of the disk._x000D_",

As history will record that during this period of troubled economic times individual states realizing the lack of Federal action have spent enormous amounts of money to try and protect our waters?  It should also be noted that this administration despite knowing of the terrorist threat, and ecological, and human health problems has as yet failed to address the problem of ballast water and appears to be leaving it up to the military plan which follows the IMO, an organization of foreign countries, foreign companies, and foreign sea captains knowing that their organization has a terrible track record. It should also be noted that the Secretary of State is calling for a quick ratification of the Law of the Sea Treaty. By ratifying the law of the Sea Treaty without first establishing a national ballast water policy, the problem is the provisions in the treaty mirror the IMO on ballast water. Ratification of this treaty first will make it much harder to later implement national ballast water policy. With a myriad of state laws that will be impossible to enforce, without an infrastructure and the Coast Guard working on their two decade plan industry knows it has won. This is evident by a recent article in The Maritime Executive magazine where Joseph Keefe states that the regulations drawn up by individual states are only a pipe dream. http://www.maritime-executive.com/article/still-swimming-upstream-invasive-species-battle-anything-over/ _x000D_\nAs I have talked about my state failing to address water transported across state lines to our watersheds in fish movement, I would like to mention that these regulations were drawn up during the last governor\u2019s administration. As I previously mention in a post you do not show, a state official stated to me that they new what they were doing.  It should be noted that Governor Patterson was instrumental in establishing some of the toughest ballast water regulations in the country. Perhaps when he started this legislation in 2008 he realized that strong ballast water legislation by our next congress would be up in the air and doubted if America would have any real change. Previously only legislation that was a hoax of protection had been considered by Senators from my state that contained language such as   in so far as is per actable. Obviously the president should acknowledge the governors of all states that have been prudent to protect our waters as they may be facing fiscal crisis, and have had to spend huge amounts of money in these though economic times to insure our protection since the Federal government has failed.     _x000D_",

I don't know how this task force's work will play out but I can say this: don't plan for any restrictions to the public's use of these lakes. Restrictions against public use will be met with total opposition on your door step, in the courts, in the capitols and at the ballot box. We all want sustainability of our natural resources and the states around the Great Lakes are doing just fine, thank you. This task force idea smacks of a liberal environmental agenda. Pardon the pun, but it sounds fishy. You will be watched closely. ",

    "Comment": "The Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition (ASOC) applauds the Interagency Ocean Policy Task Force on developing an Interim Framework for Effective Coastal and Marine Spatial Planning, which sets out the principles for future policy. Although we understand that the primary focus of the policy is on the Great Lakes and U.S. marine jurisdiction, we urge that the framework provide more detail on how its excellent principles will apply to U.S. participation in international ocean governance. As mentioned in our previous comments, the United States is a key player in the Antarctic Treaty System and the International Maritime Organization. \n\nFor example, the report notes \u201cSimilarly, as the United States is a leader in various international fora that deal with marine issues, the United States should introduce relevant aspects of CMSP for consideration by such bodies.\u201d  It would be valuable to state what some of those relevant aspects are and describe how the U.S. plans to get them implemented.  The report provides clear detail on the procedures and timelines by which regions should develop their Coastal and Marine Spatial plans (CMS plans), but in terms of international fora, no such plans are discussed.  ASOC submits that U.S. leadership in the governance of the Antarctic and Southern Ocean at meetings of the ATCM, CCAMLR and the IMO make the region a natural first choice for developing a unified Southern Ocean policy reflecting the new national priorities.  \nAlthough we are not suggesting the creation of a regional planning body for the Antarctic, as there are for regions of the United States, ASOC submits that the final framework should offer a similar mechanism and a timeline for developing a plan that sets specific policy for the US to promote at meetings relevant to the Antarctic.  \n\nASOC recognizes that the consensus-based decision making of international bodies makes it more challenging to implement plans and goals. However, this makes it all the more important to identify objectives for the Antarctic region over a reasonable time frame, and an action plan to obtain those results, including consultation with scientists and other experts; analysis of data, uses, services, and impacts; and creation of a final equivalent CMS plan for NOC review.  Doing so will help other ATS parties formulate specific goals for relevant instruments at these meetings.  It will also provide a template for U.S. policy coordination on other international ocean governance issues.  \n\nIn this context, we note there is some important overlap between Antarctic and Arctic policy objectives. Through US leadership, the Antarctic Treaty Parties and Arctic Council have agreed to work on a legally binding Polar Code at the IMO, whose negotiation begins this year.  \n\nASOC strongly urges the U.S. to take a leadership role in moving these concepts forward in the Antarctic context.

On the Weather Channel this morning, they showed a video about Long Beach, with tons of trash on the beach from the rain. Our Engineering Team has been working on solutions to this problem, where a heavy rain washes tons of floating plastic debris down the Santa Ana River, to the ocean._x000D_\n_x000D_\nAt this moment, there is approximately 125 tons of trash on Orange County beaches. It has been washed down from San Bernardino and Riverside. This land-based debris is allowed to wash down from the land into the ocean, without abatement or mitigation._x000D_\n_x000D_\nMost of the trash has been washed out to sea, and only a portion remains stuck on the beach. The trash on the beach will now be washed out to sea tomorrow or the next day, and will be replaced with different trash. We have some amazing pictures of the large amount of floating trash on the beach at Seal Beach CA, which boggles the mind. We can supply the pictures if requested._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis SoCal Express, where tons of floating plastic trash is dumped into the world\u2019s largest landfill (the Ocean) during each rainfall, provides a means for the Floaters to foray into the Gyre in the North Pacific Ocean, where the floating plastic will be able to disintegrate over a period of 500 years or more._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis makes California a potential culprit in this situation, because we basically allow all of the floating plastic trash to go straight to the ocean. The Surfrider Foundation stops the undeterred flow of plastic debris by having scheduled beach cleanups, which are very effective. Our associated Gyre Technical Engineering Team is designing facilities and equipment which will intercept the land-based floating plastic debris, get it under control, and recycle the plastic into usable products such as plastic wood._x000D_\n_x000D_\nIt is much more efficient and cost effective to collect the floating trash near its source. If we collect the trash at the mouth of the Santa Ana River, it will be much cheaper than going 2,500 miles to the center of the North Pacific Ocean to collect it and bring it back here to California._x000D_\n_x000D_\nOur Team, which includes the Surfrider Foundation and the Gyre Technical Engineering Team, is performing Engineering Analysis which has shown that we need to mitigate the Plastic Gyre in the middle of the North Pacific Ocean. We also need to stop the unmitigated flow of floating plastic trash from the land into the Ocean. We have designed a Santa Ana Sieve Project, where we would capture and collect floating plastic trash at the mouth of the Santa Ana River, and recycle it. We are working with Cerritos College, Orange Coast College, ATEP, and UCI, to come up with Engineering Solutions to the control of the floating plastic being forced into the Ocean._x000D_\n_x000D_\nAt this time, we have pictures of the massive amount of trash on the Beach at Seal Beach CA. It is mind-boggling to figure out what to do about it, especially since there is a new storm due tonight, and the trash on the beach will be joined with new trash, or it will be swept out to sea._x000D_\n_x000D_\nOur Engineering Team has planned for this emergency situation, and need proper funding to attack the problem. We would like to be a central clearing house for:_x000D_\n1.\tDesigning and installing a system on the Santa Ana River Mouth, which will collect the land-based plastic debris as it goes by, and recycling it into usable products. This is calculated to bring in a profit once the system is operating, and will be a source for money._x000D_\n2.\tEstablishing an Orange County Coastal Beach cleanup control system, to attack the beach cleanup problems when a big storm comes to California. We have known that there are many tons of floating plastic in San Bernardino and Riverside Counties, waiting for a storm to bring the trash to Orange County beaches. Now that it is actually happening, we need to do some emergency work to minimize the damage._x000D_\n3.\tWe provided a $997,000 Proposal to the State of California EDD for the Santa Ana River Sieve Project. This would emplace a large system to gather and control the massive amount of land-based plastic trash floating to the Ocean. Although we did not get a Grant, we are continuing this project. Is there a way to get this program to go forward?_x000D_\n4.\tWe have been working with and supporting the West Coast Governor\u2019s Agreement on Ocean Health, and the President\u2019s Interagency Ocean Policy Task Force. Our vision is to provide solutions using Systems Engineering Processes and Procedures._x000D_\n_x000D_\nIn summary, we were aware of the land-based floating plastic which was going to flow down the rivers to the sea, and now we are in the middle of an emergency situation because of it. We would like to make a difference, by controlling and mitigating this mass of floating plastic, which is destined to flow out to the Ocean, where it will circulate for the next 500 years._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThank you for your time and effort._x000D_\n_x000D_\nTim Touve, Lead Engineer of the Gyre Technical Engineering Team_x000D_",

    "Comment": "Hi I would like to talk t you about saving the dolphins from being illegally kllled in Japan for their meat, in the small town of Taiji. almost 200,000 have been slaughtered including babies. I was wondering if there is anything you can do to help! I would appreciate that. The movie called \"The cove\" talks about the situation that's happening in Taiji, Japan, even the Japanese citizens do not know that this atrocity is happening. And if you want  you can buy the movie and watch it.. it's very sad. The reason for this atrocity is because Japan wants to host dolphin shows, and so they have to find a dolphin that looks like the Flipper dolphin from the 1970's and the ones that they do not pick for the show they kill them, with spears, and sell them in the fish market. On top of that the dolphins have Mercury in them a contaminated substnace and the people of japan are unaware of the meat, so many kids today have had disfunctions in their brains from eating dolphin meat. Dolphns are very much like us, they protect us from sharks, and they can hear our thoughts and what we are thinking and communicate with them. I am a strong animal activist person. i hope there is something that you can do!. Thank You.. it's very sad..._x000D_\n_x000D_\n     Chase",

Using modern techniques, it is easy to set up offshore drilling rigs that have no measurable or lasting impact on the surrounding environment, other than the fact that they are clearly visible above and below the water.  We need to recognize the importance of keeping our oceans open for commercial development, including energy resource extraction, shipping, recreation, and fishing.   Allowing all of these activities to take place in our oceans is critical to keeping our economy functioning.  We can do all these things without harming the environment, and therefore there is no need to ban economic activities in our oceans under the guise of protecting the environment.  Our oceans are very robust, and the environment has recovered many times from accidents or negligence that appeared to be very damaging at the time, so responsible use of the oceans for economically profitable activities will create no measurable harm.",

By ensuring that offshore areas in the Gulf, Atlantic, Pacific and Alaska remain open to responsible oil, natural gas and alternative energy development, the federal government will provide the nation with the opportunity to safely produce our own energy, an effort that will provide significant benefits to our economy by creating domestic jobs and decreasing our dependence on foreign energy._x000D_\nAny ocean zoning or Coastal and Marine Spatial Planning system must be implemented with the appropriate input from commercial and recreational interests, in order to support commerce, trade and the U.S. economy, and ensure the basic rights and freedoms of individuals and institutions that benefit from our nation\u2019s oceans, watersheds and their resources and services._x000D_\nI strongly encourage the Task Force to create a framework for coastal and marine planning that does not actively discriminate against the sensible development of our offshore energy resources or other economic uses, including commercial and recreational activities.

National Information Management System_x000D_\na. The California Marine Life Protection Act (MLPA) decision support tool, MarineMap, should be used as a model for developing the National Information Management System decision support tool.  _x000D_\nb. To address data gaps, the National Information Management System should identify and map: marine topography, oceanography, environmentally sensitive areas, marine mammal and bird nesting, breeding, and pup rearing areas, distribution of marine communities, ocean energy resources, and other potential and proposed ocean use areas.       _x000D_\n_x000D_\n2. National Objectives, Performance Measures, and Guidance  _x000D_\na. A national ecological objective should be to set aside ecologically unique and sensitive marine habitats that are subject to minimal human disturbance. These areas should be managed with the goal of protecting ecosystems and biodiversity.  _x000D_\n_x000D_\n3. Stakeholder Advisory Bodies to Inform Regional Work Plans_x000D_\na. EDC supports establishing a stakeholder advisory body to inform the Regional Planning Bodies and Regional Work Plans.  EDC would like to represent the conservation community should a West Coast Advisory Body be formed. _x000D_\nb. Existing efforts and frameworks that can be leveraged in California to initiate the Marine Spatial Planning process on the West Coast include: the Coastal Zone Management Act; the west coast National Marine Sanctuaries; the California State Water Resources Control Board and Regional Water Quality Control Boards; the California Coastal Commission; the California Ocean Protection Council, and the Marine Life Protection Act.   _x000D_\n_x000D_\nThese recommendation are discussed in further detail in the attached document. _x000D_",

    "Comment": "To the extent that American petroleum companies are straitjacketed by  Federal regulation, the Federal Government has chosen, consciously, to fund Islamic terrorism against America and its people. _x000D_\nEvery domestic energy resource held as off-limits to producers - in effect preserved as a bizarre species of religious shrine, not to be sullied by the sinful presence of humanity; every barrel of American oil left unharvested - is a barrel of oil that must therefore be purchased from OPEC, a cartel documented as having funneled petroleum revenues into the coffers of al-Qaida terrorists.  So in a very real sense, should America once again suffer a terrorist attack, we can lay responsibility directly at the feet of those guilty of \"planning\" (read: shutting down) American energy production at gunpoint. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nConversely, we have it within our power to essentially bankrupt OPEC and restore America's position as the world's #1 oil producing nation:_x000D_\n~ Every barrel of oil produced domestically is: _x000D_\n...a barrel not purchased from OPEC;_x000D_\n...therefore revenue denied to terrorists and terrorist organizations funded directly or indirectly by OPEC members;_x000D_\n...a barrel produced via American labor;_x000D_\n...a barrel added to the global oil supply, representing downward pressure on prices;_x000D_\n...which in turn represents an instant spur toward a massive economic expansion and consequent net gain in the standard of living for people of all income levels;_x000D_\n...is a barrel that can be exported and sold on the global market, which too represents a net gain for the American economy - therefore for American jobs and standard of living;_x000D_\n...is an announcement to the world that America, once again, has committed itself to becoming the world's #1 petroleum producer;_x000D_\n...is a unit of measure in the restoration of the U.S. balance of trade._x000D_\n_x000D_\nWe have, in essence, arrived at a point at which the continued constriction of domestic American energy resource production - again, by brute force - can no longer be justified either morally or practically - if indeed it ever could._x000D_\n_x000D_\nSo the real question here is one of Ethics vs. a fetishistic lust for power for power's sake.  But power implies two questions: \"Over whom?\" and \"To what ultimate end?\"  The answers to those questions, in the present context, are too evil to be given voice in rational, civilized discourse.  _x000D_\n_x000D_\nEverybody knows what is the ethical path here.  Unfortunately, everybody similarly knows that the chance that that path will actually be chosen in lieu of the unethical path, is likely next to nil, pending the advent of a new renaissance of human rights in America.  Which means the function of this comment will likely be relegated to that of identification._x000D_\nSo...welcome to your identity, whatever you choose to make it.

    "Comment": "The interim framework for coastal and marine spatial planning (msp) report does a good job of outlining the process and the three phase implementation process over the next five years. My concern as a resident of Cape Cod, Ma. is that ongoing efforts locally, statewide and regionally are going forward in the interim which could make this national program irrelevant. Thus there is a need for the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) and its regional partner (Northeast Regional Ocean Council, NROC) to engage in these processes now and not wait for 2-3 years, while their msp proposal is being implemented._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThe other point I would like to make is that the msp is linked to an adaptive, ecosystem-based management framework (A, EbM) and the report should describe this component in more detail. It is important to integrate the CEQ/NROC endeavors with state and local msp activities. The Cape Cod Commission (CCC) is developing an Ocean Management District of Critical Planning Concern (DCPC) off of our coast within the framework of the recently released Massachusetts Ocean Management Plan (MOMP). MOMP will be managed by the state's Coastal Zone Management (CZM) Office._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThe Minerals Management Service (MMS) has established a state task of federal, state, local and tribal officials to develop large scale wind farms in 4000 square nautical miles off of our coast. A recent story in the Vineyard Gazette entitled: \"Federal Offshore Energy Plans Dwarf Cape Wind\" shows that the MMS renewable energy development plans are entirely separate from the CEQ msp endeavors. Most of this region is essential fish habitat for fisheries harvesting._x000D_\n_x000D_\nNOAA Fisheries (NMFS) and the New England Fishery Management Council (NEFMC) are  developing an Omnibus Habitat Amendment which will propose extensive Habitat Areas of Particular Concern (HAPC) off of our coast. NMFS also regulates the critical habitats/migratory pathways for the  highly endangered endangered North Atlantic right whale which pass off our coast. Finally NROC and the Gulf of Maine Council for the Marine Environment (GOMC) are supporting a proposal for conservation and restoration of the Gulf of Maine which extends to the south side of Cape Cod. The MOMP plan identified an ocean protection zone off of the Cape Cod National Seashore which is adjacent to the Great South Channel (HAPC and critical whale habitat)._x000D_\n_x000D_\n Thus we face challenges in balancing environmental protection with human use in our coastal and offshore ocean waters. We need to tie together these diverse ocean planning and development efforts or regulatory chaos will occur.",

    "Comment": "The Interim Framework presents a sound and flexible template of action items that guides regional authorities towards creating priorities that address economic, social, and environmental concerns. In terms of federal action affecting coastal and marine areas, regional authorities should be empowered to provide direction to federal agencies in prioritizing federal projects and regulation when considering social, economic, and environmental factors. Outside of federal action, though, the framework should have regional authorities guide, not direct, local and state governments in prioritization of project locations and types and enforcement within the governments\u2019 respective jurisdictions. This guidance would make local and state governments more apt to follow the recommendations of the regional authorities than have control fully ceded to these authorities.",

Implementation mentions stakeholder engagement and conflict resolution.  Performance measures include economic valuation and duration of the permitting process.  To actually facilitate these performance goals for real-world projects, the Framework should address methods to mitigate the present situation where conflicting groups use lawsuits and repetitive technical challenges, more as effective weapons to increase costs and lengthen the permitting process to debilitate a particular development project, than as tools to resolve legitimate grievances.  Recognizing that some stakeholders will never accede in a conflict of interests, the Framework should provide definition of the authority to enforce binding arbitration to realize the benefits of the holistic planning approach.  Additionally, existing laws, regulations and policies should be harmonized to reduce conflicting requirements, and any vague or overly-broad language be reviewed to strike a workable balance between protection and compatible use, and to permit reasonable exceptions.",

Fish stocks are collapasing or in danger of doing so around the globe, affecting ALL, not just ocean dwellers.  Pirate fishing operations, renegade long line fishing which traps and imperils sea creatures beyond the  ones intended, trawlers that disturb the ocean bottoms irreparably, so-called \"scientific\" hunting of whales, pollution of the oceans, from human and toxic waste to plastic that continues in the ecosystem, just in  smaller and smaller  pieces, and the impact of global climate changes are just some of the overwhelming problems that are tipping the balance from healthy to unhealthy in our oceans. Our oceans need our best and strongest efforts, not half-measures, doublespeak or delays.  Using the oceans as military playgrounds also had to go.  For instance, the highly endangered right whale doesnot need to be adversely impacted by military exercises in or adjacent to their calving ground off the coastof  GA and FL.

    "Comment": "Letter to President Obama and the Ocean Policy Task Force:\nThank you for your work to create a National Ocean Policy and a framework for coastal and marine spatial planning (CMSP).  The draft Policy and the Interim Planning Framework include many elements that are essential to success, including an emphasis on ecosystem-based management and a call to use a precautionary approach and address cumulative impacts.  \nI urge you to strengthen both the Policy and the Framework further before they are finalized.  Conservation should be a clear and central purpose of a National Ocean Policy.  Protecting, maintaining, and restoring ecosystem health should be made a priority of CMSP, including provisions to protect important ecological areas and other special places. Further, the Framework should be multi-objective and include all major ocean uses.  \nFinally, please enact the Task Force's report by issuing an Executive Order that establishes a National Ocean Policy and a means for coordinated implementation of that policy, including through individual agency actions and an interagency national oceans council, and an effective framework for coastal and marine spatial planning. \nSuch an action would help to ensure that our oceans, coasts and Great Lakes are healthier now and for future generations.\n\nTHANK YOU FOR HELPING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR OUR OCEANS!! - Wear Blue Team\n\n",

    "Comment": "Mr. President, \n\nI am adamantly opposed to the proposed marine spatial planning of the Ocean Policy Task Force. Having commercially and recreationally fished, I am greatly concerned about the impact uch a policy would have on the fishing community of this nation. Fish do not abide by invisible man-made boundaries. It is simply not a viable mechanism for fishery management. To zone where fishing may and may not occur, where boats may and may not go, will devastate this oldest of American industries/pasttimes and contribute unnecessarily to the loss of thousands of jobs and livelihoods and possibly billions of dollars worth of income to this nation in a difficult economic climate. Not to mention that fish stocks are at their highest in years, which removes any reason for impeding their sustainable harvest. Furthermore, the Task Force has not considered the jurisdictions of NOAA, the National Marine Fisheries Service, and itself with regard to fisheries. Nothing has been made clear and transparent about the interaction of these agencies, which is a great cause of concern to the fishing community. Again, I am adamantly opposed to the creation of marine spatial planning over our nation's fisheries and do not believe that the Ocean Policy Task Force should override the jurisdictions of federally legislated and mandated agencies -NOAA and the NMFS- who, under federal law, have exclusive power to enact fisheries management plans. I would ask that the Task Force recommend that serious consideration be given to these issues before proceeding with the proposed action. ",

    "Comment": "Ms. Nancy Sutley, Chair\n\nCouncil on Environmental Quality\n\n722 Jackson Place, N.W.\n\nWashington, D.C. 20503\n\n\n\nDear Ms. Sutley:\n\n\n\nThe Climate Policy Fairness Coalition (\u201cCPFC\u201d) submits this letter in response to the request for public comments regarding the Interim Framework for Coastal and Marine Spatial Planning (\u201cCMSP Report\u201d) published on December 9, 2009.\n\n\n\nExisting Regulatory Systems And The CMSP Report\n\n\n\nThe CMSP Report at 18 states the ocean spatial plans will \u201cdescribe the spatial determinations for conservation and uses\u201d in the ocean.  In short, the CMSP Report proposes a system of ocean zoning.  However, the question is the legal standing of a coastal and marine spatial plan (\u201cCMS Plan\u201d) if it designates areas closed to ocean activities, or otherwise adopts programs, that are different from those duly established pursuant to statute?  If, for example, a CMS Plan designates an area closed to certain uses because of the alleged impacts of global warming, and if that closure or restricted use conflicts with an ocean use permitted by a program adopted pursuant to statute, does the restriction in the CMS Plan override the program adopted pursuant to statute?\n\n\n\nConsider, as but one example, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (\u201cOCSLA\u201d).  That statute vests the Interior Department with the authority for planning, leasing, and issuing permits for mineral exploration and development on the Outer Continental Shelf.  Activities governed under the OCSLA include oil and gas development, the extraction of non-energy minerals such as sand and gravel, and energy projects including sources such as wind and solar.\n\n\n\nPursuant to the OCSLA, the Interior Department, acting through the Minerals Management Service (\u201cMMS\u201d), develops five-year leasing programs for oil and gas activities.  Development of these plans provides numerous opportunities for public input.  Equally important, these plans consider the economic, environmental, and social issues associated with leasing.  This encompasses a complete review of all environmental and other values associated with a potential leasing site, including the impact on the ecosystem.  After identifying appropriate areas for leasing, MMS may proceed with an actual lease sale that involves additional economic, social, and environmental analyses.  Following this stage, there are separate approvals required for an exploration plan and for a development and production plan.  Each plan is the subject of environmental and other analyses.  The OCSLA also vests the Interior Department with the authority to grant rights-of-way to transport oil, natural gas and other minerals from the leased site to land.  Like the leasing and plan approval process described above, decisions on granting rights-of-way are subject to extensive analyses.\n\n\n\nIn short, existing law already establishes a complete spatial planning and environmental regulatory regime for energy production activities in the ocean.  Other statutes establish similarly comprehensive ocean planning and conservation programs.  However, the CMSP Report states that signatories of the CMS Plans, which presumably will include all Cabinet Secretaries, will make \u201can express commitment ... to act in accordance with the plan ... to ensure their respective activities ... adhere to the CMS Plan to the extent possible.\u201d  Id. at 20.  Moreover, the CMSP Report provides that the newly created National Ocean Council (\u201cNOC\u201d) will \u201censure\u201d that CMS Plans are consistent with, among other things, a National Policy, performance measures, and guidelines developed by the NOC.  Id. \n\n \n\nThe critical legal question is whether an Executive Order issued by the President, and CMS Plans developed under that Order, become a binding requirement with which each federal agency must comply when implementing its statutory duties.  If the drafters of the CMSP Report intend the answer to be yes, and if CMS Plans are to be used as a back door way to zone the ocean to account for alleged impacts of global warming, notwithstanding programs adopted pursuant to existing statutes, it will present very significant legal issues, including constitutional questions involving separation of powers.\n\n\n\nThe Precautionary Principle\n\n\n\nThe CMSP Report states the coastal and marine spatial planning program leading to CMS Plans \u201cwould utilize the best available data....\u201d  CMSP Report at 32.  Do the drafters of the CMSP Report intend that CMS Plans be used to establish what constitutes the best scientific data with respect to those statutes that require federal decisions makers to use the best available scientific information?  If that is the intent, once again, it raises serious legal issues because it replaces existing statutory processes for determining what constitutes the best scientific information with a new process grounded only in an Executive Order.  \n\n\n\nThe CMSP Report also states the coastal and marine spatial planning process will be guided by the precautionary principle defined in the Rio Declaration of 1992.  That principle states:  \u201cWhere there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation.\u201d\n\n\n\nIf the intent of the drafters of the CMSP Report is to use the Rio Declaration to impose new legal requirements on the decision making process set forth in existing statutes, the legal and constitutional issues addressed above are applicable.  Furthermore, the 1992 Rio Declaration precautionary principle raises additional issues of significant legal consequence.\n\n\n\nThe first such issue involves the risk assessment trigger that there is a \u201cserious\u201d threat of environmental damage.  Webster\u2019s Dictionary defines \u201cserious\u201d as \u201crelating to a matter of importance\u201d or \u201chaving important or dangerous possible consequences.\u201d  Thus, the word \u201cserious\u201d has some meaning greater than detectable or known.  There must be some consequential impact that rises to a level of significance or substantiality.  However, the word \u201cserious\u201d is not the commonly used term in environmental statutes.  The National Environment Policy Act speaks of \u201cmajor\u201d actions \u201csignificantly affecting\u201d the environment.  In the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the operative words are \u201cimminent and substantial\u201d endangerment.  The Endangered Species Act focuses on jeopardy to the very survival of the species.  Which of these standards, or what other standard, is the proper frame of reference for the legally untested concept of \u201cserious\u201d?  Alternatively, and absent statutory precedent, are we to employ the well understood judicial injunction standard of irreparable harm?  This question is not addressed in the CMSP Report.  However, resolving this question would seem to be a Congressional function via a duly enacted statute.\n\n\n\nFurther, what are the factors to be weighed in determining if a proposal presents a \u201cserious\u201d threat to the environment?  Is the impact on fish and wildlife or natural processes the only measure of \u201cserious\u201d damage or is that evaluation to be made in a larger context of the entire human environment?  That larger context would include benefits to humans, including economic or similar benefits, that result in an overall balancing of interests to determine what is \u201cserious.\u201d  A proposal may appear \u201cserious\u201d only if a larger context is not provided.\n\n\n\nIn addressing the risk assessment threshold, what does the Rio Declaration mean when it states \u201cthe lack of scientific certainty\u201d shall not be a reason for postponing actions?  What level of scientific certainty is to be applied in making the \u201cserious\u201d determination?  American jurisprudence is based on the principles of preponderance of evidence and beyond a reasonable doubt.  Is it the intent of the CMSP Report to establish a new evidentiary standard that is less than the preponderance of evidence?  If so, is the standard to be some evidentiary basis found some place, a plausible belief, or something else?  If the great weight of evidence says there is no \u201cserious\u201d issue but a few minority opinions hold to the contrary, does this constitute scientific uncertainty justifying regulatory action?  Such a principle runs contrary to well established legal standards and should not be included in any Executive Order or other document.\n\n\n\nIn addition, to whom is assigned the burden of proof regarding whether there is a \u201cserious\u201d effect?  Does the opponent of an action bear that burden or must the proponent prove by some unknown evidentiary standard that there is no \u201cserious\u201d impact?  Placement of the burden of proof is not an insignificant legal matter.  It is also inextricably intertwined with the issue of what level of proof is required.\n\n\n\nAssuming these issues are somehow resolved, any Executive Order or other document seeking to implement the Rio Declaration must recognize and fully implement the standard in that Declaration that only \u201ccost-effective\u201d measures may be adopted \u201cto prevent environmental degradation.\u201d\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nThe CPFC believes the marine spatial planning initiative is being rushed through without full and adequate consideration of all the issues.  For that reason, the CPFC recommends that this process be withdrawn so that there can be a more thorough analysis of the policy, legal, and constitutional issues associated with implementing the CMSP Report.\n\n\n\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\nTHE CLIMATE POLICY FAIRNESS COALITION\n\nBy:  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tGeorge J.

    "Comment": "Comments to the Interagency Ocean Policy Task Force\n\nOn Its Interim Framework For\n\nEffective Coastal and Marine Spatial Planning\n\nFebruary 10, 2010\n\n\n\nSubmitted by \n\nAt-sea Processors Association\n\nFreezer Longline Coalition\n\nGroundfish Forum\n\nNorth Pacific Crab Association\n\nPacific Seafood Processors Association\n\nUnited Catcher Boats\n\n\n\nI.  Summary of Views\n\n\n\n\tThe organizations listed above have serious concerns with the Interim Framework for Effective Coastal and Marine Spatial Planning published by the Interagency Ocean Policy Task Force on December 14, 2009.  The coastal and marine spatial planning (CMSP) framework proposal could easily undermine the regional fishery management process established under the Magnuson Stevens Act (MSA), including reducing public participation in the conservation and management of the nation\u2019s marine fisheries.  The framework poses a threat to jobs and the overall economic health of the commercial and sport fishing industries, which contribute $185 billion annually to the U.S. economy.  We urge the Task Force to reconsider its approach, revisit, and broaden stakeholder consultation, and delay forwarding any recommendations to President Obama until the concerns identified below are fully addressed.\n\n\n\nII.  Background on the Signatories\n\n\n\nThe commercial fishing and fish processing associations listed above represent harvesters and processors participating in the major fisheries in state and federal waters off Alaska and the U.S. west coast.  The fisheries in which we participate account for more than half of all seafood landed annually in the U.S.  \n\n\n\nIII.  Concerns With Provisions of the Interim Framework for CMSP\n\n\n\nThe mandate of the proposed regional planning bodies is overly broad and will conflict with and undermine conservation and management requirements of the Magnuson Stevens Act (MSA), including the responsibilities of the eight existing regional fishery management councils.  \n\n\n\n\tThe interim framework (see p. 3) states that marine spatial planning is \u201cintended to improve ecosystem health and services by planning human uses in concert with the conservation of important ecological areas, such as areas of high productivity and biodiversity; areas and key species that are critical to ecosystem function and resiliency; areas of spawning, breeding, and feeding\u2026\u201d  Although the interim framework states that the planning process in not intended to supersede existing law, it is difficult to reach any conclusion other than the regional fishery management process will be undermined by the proposed CMSP framework.  \n\n\n\nCurrently, the MSA establishes eight regional fishery management councils that are required, among other things, to establish fishery management plans to conserve and manage marine fisheries and to conserve and enhance essential fish habitat, which has been interpreted as covering virtually all federal waters.  The interim framework does not draw a bright line between its vision of interagency panels developing conservation plans relating to \u201carea of spawning, breeding, and feeding\u201d and the current obligations of regional fishery management councils under the MSA to conserve and manage species throughout their range and to protect essential fish habitat.  At best, the interim framework appears to create a redundant process.  Perhaps more troubling, it would be a process that involves myriad federal agencies without expertise in managing living marine resources and one that does not provide for sufficient participation for affected user groups.\n\n\n\nThe proposed regional planning process provides far less transparency and public participation than the MSA\u2019s regional fishery management decision making process.\n\n\n\nThe interim framework grants planning responsibility to a hodgepodge of federal agencies with some limited participation by states and tribes.  This proposed federalized approach contrasts with the proven track record of sound conservation and enhanced stakeholder participation achieved in the North Pacific and Pacific regional fishery management council processes.  Regional fishery management councils are comprised of individuals nominated by Governors and appointed by the Commerce Secretary.  Council nominees are required by law to be \u201cknowledgeable regarding the conservation and management, or the commercial or recreational harvest, of the fishery resources of the geographical area concerned.\u201d  (See section 302(b) of the MSA.)  The MSA\u2019s regulatory process requires decision making informed by knowledgeable and experienced stakeholders.  Congress has reaffirmed this approach in countless reauthorizations of the law, which was adopted more than 30 years ago.  There is no evidence to suggest that this system would be improved by federal officials\u2014most coming from agencies with no practical experience in living marine resource management\u2014deciding critical environmental matters that affect the future of the U.S. commercial fishing industry.\n\n\n\n\tLooking beyond just the expertise of NOAA and the regional fishery councils, which is considerable, the task force should understand that these decision makers are further supported by fishing industry advisory committees and scientific panels that include individuals who \u201chave strong scientific or technical credentials and experience.\u201d  (See section 302(g) of the MSA.)  The MSA further sets out extensive requirements for public participation at all stages of the decision making process.  Virtually all of the present statutory requirements for requiring experience and expertise among decision makers and all the safeguards for providing public input into the management of marine fisheries would be undermined by an inter-agency \u201cplanning process\u201d that could establish federal policies that propose managing areas or commercial fish species in a manner inconsistent with National Standards set forth in the MSA. \n\n\n\n\tThe interim framework claims that \u201cCMSP would improve (emphasis added) opportunities for community and citizen participation,\u201d but it is difficult to see how a process dominated by an alphabet soup of federal departments and agencies enhances public participation by supplanting a federal fishery management process that provides meaningful stakeholder participation on the decision making bodies and extensive opportunities for public comment.  \n\n\n\nInteragency decision making would override the informed decision making process of expert agencies on research priorities and, perhaps more importantly, override individual agency responsibilities and programs.\n\n\n\n\tWhile the framework makes reference to plans not having the weight of regulations, there are repeated references to agencies \u201cfully implementing\u201d the CMSP by seeking regulatory or legislative changes.  In addition, \u201cState and Federal authorities with programs relevant to the CMSP would review and modify programs as appropriate to ensure their respective activities, including discretionary spending\u2026adhere to the CMSP to the extent possible.\u201d  This text is astonishing in its scope.  It seems apparent that the intent is for the untested CMSP process to trump existing practices that are working successfully.  At present in the fisheries off Alaska and the west coast, NOAA Fisheries coordinates with the regional fishery management councils and other marine science and management entities to establish short-term and long-term research priorities and programs.  Embracing an ecosystem-based approach, limited discretionary funding is distributed among research needs to improve understanding of climate change, marine mammal populations, fish, and sea bird populations, habitat, environmental conditions (including ocean temperature, currents and wind), and dozens of other important areas of inquiry.\n\n\n\n\tThe framework proposes that the priorities for discretionary spending on vital but very specific areas of concentration be directed by an interagency planning body supposedly developing policy at the large marine ecosystem (LME) level.    (See p. 20 of the Interim Framework.)  This section of the framework also states that \u201cState and Federal agencies would also be expected to formally incorporate relevant components of the CMS Plan into their ongoing operations or activities consistent with existing law.\u201d  Notwithstanding language in the draft about such action being undertaken \u201cconsistent with existing law,\u201d the framework is clear that \u201cagencies should consider whether to seek regulatory or legislative changes to fully implement the CMSP.\u201d  \n\n\n\n\tIn short, the interim framework seeks to have it both ways.  On the one hand, policies and plans are being sold as having no regulatory authority, while on the other hand the intent is clear that this new process will in fact shape every agency\u2019s discretionary spending, its regulatory activities, and statutory requirements.  This document goes far beyond establishing a broadly coordinated oceans policy.  Instead, it appears to create a centralized organ for micromanaging all federal and state ocean-related programs.\n\n\n\nThe framework\u2019s description of National Ocean Council (NOC) guidance, like the CMSP, suggests that significant authority is vested in the NOC to usurp MSA responsibilities conferred upon NOAA and the regional fishery management councils.\n\n\n\n\tThe interim framework proposes that the NOC would not only establish broad national objectives (which may or may not be consistent with the MSA\u2019s National Standards) but would establish \u201cnational outcome-based performance measures.\u201d  The NOC\u2019s objectives would require regional planning bodies to \u201cdevelop region-specific objectives and associated performance measures.\u201d  These broad mandates, which arguably could be imposed by a White House-level entity exempt from public interest protections enshrined in the National Environmental Policy (NEPA), could result in major impacts to our fleets without proper public process and involve an overly complicated bureaucracy.  Current commercial fishing closures, for example, are instituted through a transparent public process consistent with NEPA, MSA, and other statutes and, most importantly, are designed to achieve specific conservation goals.  NOC-developed national performance measures or region specific performance measures could quite readily supersede the MSA process with its tested public process for implementing plans and regulations pertaining to catch levels, restrictions on types of fishing gear, and seasonal or area closures.\n\n\n\nThe proposal to establish regional planning areas that are intended to mirror large marine ecosystems (LMEs) does not take into account critical socioeconomic considerations.\n\n\n\n\tThe draft CMSP document states that each regional planning body \u201cshould make every effort to ensure representation from all States within a region, ideally through, or as part of, the existing regional governance structures created by States\u2026\u201d  The draft, however, makes no provision for Pacific Northwest (PNW) states to participate in the Alaska/Arctic Region planning bodies, notwithstanding the significant economic interdependence between Alaska and PNW states.  In commercial fisheries alone, Washington and Oregon-based fishermen and fish processors have an enormous stake in fisheries occurring in waters off Alaska, particularly federally managed fisheries that are valued at more than $2.0 billion annually.  Nothing in this framework provides for Pacific Northwest commercial fishing interests, PNW states, or for the North Pacific Fishery Management Council to participate meaningfully in the CMSP process.  Instead, this proposal appears to diminish the decision making authority of the North Pacific Council, a regional planning entity with considerable public participation opportunities that is often recognized for successful precautionary, ecosystem-based federal resource management.  This proposal threatens to undermine public confidence in fisheries management processes that manage fisheries accounting for half of all seafood landed annually in the U.S.\n",

    "Comment": "Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection_x000D_\nOffice of Long Island Sound Programs_x000D_\nFebruary 11, 2010_x000D_\n_x000D_\n_x000D_\nComments on Interim Framework for Effective Coastal and Marine Spatial Planning_x000D_\n_x000D_\n_x000D_\nThe Interim Framework sets forth an ambitious program of institution-building and plan development, according to a specific timetable and with significant responsibilities assigned to states and regional ocean organizations.  While increased data gathering, monitoring, evaluation and coordination across all levels of government are definitely necessary to make ocean spatial planning function, state agencies will be expected to take on more work with greater demands on staff resources.  State coastal management programs in particular are already struggling with increasing performance measurement requirements and new federal mandates, with level funding for the past few years.  We are concerned that, without additional resources, a regional CMSP system will simply add another institutional layer of management that will impair rather than facilitate coordination by diverting existing programmatic efforts.  _x000D_\nThe Interim Framework also provides requirements for signatory agencies to ensure consistency with regional CMSPs in implementing their responsibilities.  The concept of binding regional spatial plans merits some consideration, especially with respect to federal agencies such as FERC that have not always been amenable to coordinating their mission with environmental and natural resource agencies.  However, ocean and coastal management has not been immune from the federal government\u2019s tendency to create new programs without superseding or incorporating existing ones, and we are concerned that CMSP compliance mechanisms must effectively coordinate with, or even replace if necessary, existing authorities.  For example, the Coastal Zone Management Act offers an existing model of an intergovernmental mechanism that attempts to achieve coordinated management of coastal resources and uses at all levels of government.  To avoid wasteful duplication and promote efficiency, regional CMSPs should not be overlaid onto, but perhaps incorporated within, the CZMA framework, even using CZMA reauthorization as a vehicle for statutory changes necessary to implement CMSP.  Alternatively, CZMA could be reinvented and incorporated within a new and comprehensive regional ocean planning framework.  In any case, implementation requirements for enforcing consistency with regional MSPs must recognize the sovereignty and primary role of states with regard to managing state waters, and should support, or at least not conflict with, state coastal management programs._x000D_\nBorders between regions should not arbitrarily divide ecosystems or waterbodies along political boundaries.  Connecticut\u2019s entire coast and \u201cocean\u201d is comprised of Long Island Sound, which we share with the State of New York.  However, the Interim Report lists Connecticut in the Northeast Region, while New York is placed in both the Mid-Atlantic and Great lakes regions.  According to the Report text (although the map on page 11 appears to indicate otherwise), the boundary between the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic Regions would therefore run along the Connecticut-New York border, dividing Long Island Sound among two regions.  It would seem important for both LIS states to coordinate directly within the same regional organization, since we are already partners in the LISS NEP.  Indeed, since New York is already in two regions, why not place it in the Northeast region as well\u2014especially since Vermont, which is largely in the St. Lawrence-Great Lakes watershed, has been allocated to the Northeast Region on the basis of a more tenuous connection. _x000D_\nThe Interim Framework proposes creation of a system for Scientific Knowledge and Data Integration, Research, Management and Access.  We have several concern regarding this effort: 1) data collection, management and storage must be prioritized at the national level regarding specific spatial planning objectives, and a national framework must be provided to ensure consistency from region to region for review of both ocean- and land-based activities.  At the same time, the identification and pursuit of national science priorities must not discount or override consideration of and action on regional science priorities; 2) the Interim Framework appears to confuse the proposed use of MHW as a fixed landward boundary with the concept of ecosystem-based management, which inherently requires flexible limits to address site-specific resources and habitat conditions; 3) the timeline for completion of Phases 1 and 2 may be overly optimistic, and the enforcement of arbitrary deadlines may jeopardize the condition and accuracy of the data obtained; and 4) specific directives or means are necessary with which to engage orleverage any existing regional entities (e.g., ocean councils/congresses, IOOS RAs, etc.) that may already be active and in place and whose mandates or goals are aligned with the CMSP framework._x000D_",

    "Comment": "Re: CMSP Framework Needs Engagement of Sub-Regional and Local Planning Agencies_x000D_\n_x000D_\nDear Ms. Chairwoman:_x000D_\n_x000D_\nThe San Luis Obispo Science & Ecosystem Alliance (SLOSEA) welcomes the release of the \u201cInterim Framework for Effective Coastal and Marine Spatial Planning.\u201d  We commend the Task Force members and staff for their diligent work, and for recognizing the need for long-term sustainable ocean resource management that includes the principles of ecosystem-based and adaptive management.  _x000D_\n_x000D_\nWe appreciate the Task Force\u2019s use of existing management structures such as the West Coast Governors\u2019 Agreement (WCGA) to build upon on-going ecosystem-based management (EBM) initiatives, which use coastal and marine spatial planning (CMSP) as a tool.  As part of the West Coast Ecosystem-Based Management Network (WCEBM Network), we have had the opportunity to interact with the WCGA in its planning processes, and have found the initiative to be very promising in helping to protect resources along the entire California Current.  However, EBM-based CMSP also requires a focus on truly regional and local institutions, and incorporation of knowledge that only existing stakeholders can bring to the table.  As the CMSP process moves into an implementation stage, we ask that the Task Force ensure the inclusion of local planning bodies, such as those established through marine EBM initiatives (e.g. SLOSEA\u2019s Regional Ecosystem Stewardship Council, and others in the WCEBM Network.)   _x000D_\n_x000D_\nDue to the extensive coastal area and governmental entities covered by the proposed \u201cWest Coast Region,\u201d we foresee serious logistical constraints in coordinating resources and ensuring meaningful stakeholder involvement across such a large region.  To mitigate these pressing concerns, we strongly recommend that sub-regional governing bodies and plans be incorporated into the final CMSP Framework.  California\u2019s ongoing CSMP process known as the Marine Life Protection Act Initiative (MLPA) has utilized five separate regions along the California coast to adequately provide for stakeholder participation and essential local scientific input in creating marine protected areas (MPAs.)  Because the Framework considers not only MPAs, but is a comprehensive assessment considering all elements of CMSP, it will undoubtedly require at a minimum the same level of stakeholder involvement and local expertise as the MPA planning process.  As a participant in the South Central MLPA Initiative, and a partner in monitoring established MPAs collaboratively with community fisherman, SLOSEA can attest to the necessity of local input in order to legitimize any coastal planning process. Although the WCGA is a starting point for West coast management, successful and efficient CMSP will require more distinct regions, such as the four established by the Task Force along the Atlantic coast. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nDesignating the entire West coast as one region overlooks the critical role that local governments play in land use decisions that significantly affect coastal water quality, marine economics, coastal preservation, recreation and other decisions critical to healthy sustainable oceans. By working with established and reputable regional stakeholder groups that include local/state government officials, scientists, resource managers, businesses and community members, the Task Force will be better informed to make lasting, effective and truly implementable CMSP decisions. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nWith our experience in linking science to marine policy and management, and our existing Regional Ecosystem Stewardship Council \u2013 a highly diverse stakeholder group \u2013 we at SLOSEA look forward to partnering with the Task Force, and forthcoming governing bodies in their CSMP decision-making process.

    "Comment": "This is the Western Fishboat Owner's Association's comment on the \"Interim Framework for Effective Coastal and Marine Spatial Planning\" Interagency Ocean Policy Task Force, Dec. 9, 2009, which is open for comment through Friday February 12, 2009. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nWFOA represents approximately 400 albacore surface troll vessels on the west coast which fish for North Pacific Albacore from May through October in the U.S. EEZ and the high seas (also under a treaty with Canada in the Canadian EEZ).  The annual catch varies between 12,000 and 16,000 short tons much of which is consumed in U.S. restaurants, super market chains such as Whole Foods, and fish markets.  It is a fully sustainable fishery which will shortly be certified by MSC (Final Report Out for Comment)._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThe WFOA fleet participates in an international fishery and the albacore resource it fishes is subject to management and conservation by both the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission and the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission.  It competes internationally with fishermen from Japan, Spain, Canada, New Zealand, China, and Chinese Taipei.  Many of the fleets from these countries receive fuel and other subsidies which the U.S. fleet does not._x000D_\n_x000D_\nDomestically it is subject to the National Marine Fisheries Services Southwestern Region and the Pacific Islands Region, as well as the Pacific Fisheries Management Council and the Western Pacific Fisheries Council.  The fleet has been documented to be not only fishing in a sustainable manner, but also fishing in an environmentally neutral way -- no bycatch problems of other fish, seabirds, marine mammals, sea turtles, etc._x000D_\n_x000D_\nWithout things such as fuel subsidies and with numerous regulations to follow which are not applied to WFOA's foreign competitors, they, like many U.S. fishing fleets,are struggling economically.  The fleet consists primarily of 40 to 100 foot family owned and operated vessels --- the small businesses which are the backbone of the U.S. economy. To make their views known and to protect their interests they already have to send representatives to two difference Magnuson Act Councils and two international RFMO's.  Another layer of bureaucracy, such as that envisioned to implement the Coastal and Marine Spatial, Planning program would be a crippling blow._x000D_\n_x000D_\nWhile they have their problems, the Magnuson Act Regional Councils which have been operating for over 30 years are probably some of the most democratic and transparent organizations in the country.  They already bring together the Departments of Commerce, State, and Interior, as well as the Coast Guard.  They are guided by panels of scientists ans stakeholders.  The Council makeup brings together commercial and recreational fishermen, environmental organizations, public interest groups, processors and the tribal nations. The structure which the interim Framework suggests already exists and is up and running.  More coordination between ocean uses and policies might well be justified, however, an organization to accomplish that should be built upon and within the Council system, and not above,and apart from it._x000D_\n_x000D_\nAs we read through the goals and guiding principles for CMSP we see nothing that is foreign to, or that cannot be accommodated  by a slight expansion of the Council system.  A separate and over arching entity would not streamline or improve the vigor of decisions, nor would it increase certainty and predictability, rather it would likely have the opposite effect. Councils are already engaged in ecosystem based management and have been for years.  They also are quite capable of accommodating the multiple existing uses, as well as the emerging uses of the ocean._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThe Interim Report is \"throwing the baby out with the bathwater\".  It would be much more useful to take the various legitimate points in the Report and utilize them to expand and improve the existing Council system._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThank you very much for the opportunity to comment on this Interim Report.

When the federal government begins partnering with different groups I want to suggest they include the Native American Fish and Wildlife Society, they are a Native American/Alaska Native Organization with regional sites throughout the United States.  While they don\u2019t speak for tribes they work with and for tribes on a national, regional and local level on natural resource and environmental issues.  I would hope that the federal government look at collaborating with them in some way when addressing ocean issues._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThey other issue I would like to bring up is Sections 109 and 117 of the Magnuson-Stevens Act (MSA).  I would like to see these sections begin to receive funding so programs for Alaska Native/Native Americans and Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islanders who want to become involved in pursuing natural resource careers would be able to do so in an expedited manner.  We are running out of time to build capacity in order to protect, rebuild, and maintain ocean health.  The following is the excerpt taken from MSA:  The Secretary shall establish a pilot program for regionally-based marine education and training programs in the Western Pacific and the Northern Pacific to foster understanding, practical use of knowledge (including native Hawaiian, Alaska Native, and other Pacific-Islander based knowledge), and technical expertise relevant to stewardship of living marine resources.  It further states that the Secretary shall, in cooperation with the Western Pacific and the North Pacific Regional Fishery Management councils, regional education institutions, and local Western Pacific and Northern Pacific community training programs, establish programs or projects that will improve communication, education, and training on marine resource issues throughout the region and increase scientific education for marine-related professions among coastal community residents, including Indigenous Pacific Islanders, Native Hawaiians, Alaska Natives, and other underrepresented groups in the region._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThank you for listening to my comments._x000D_",

In your planning for coastal communities and marine related occupations, do not let the indutrialized model of commercial fishing dominate your view of the needs of fishermen and their families and communities. Keep the US small-scale fisherman in your planning at all times. (This has unfortunately not always been the case in federal planning/management for our fisheries where \"efficiency\" has become the priority rather than an ecological approach which includes the human community._x000D_\n2. In taking the ecological approach to stewardship of the oceans,as stated in your goals, please consider all the ecological ramifications of off-shore aquaculture, especially the raising of predatory fish. Our federal government has given the green light to off-shore farms. These aquafarms not only are devouring the forage fish of the sea to produce an expensive fish the poor people of the world cannot afford, but are also producers of waste.  Your document expresses concern about the impacts on the ocean of run-off wastes from cities and farms, and related algae blooms, dead zones. These farms produce the same.  I recommend that development of them not continue until these concerns are thoroughly evaluated. Profits of private farms should not come before the health of the oceans. (Disclosure--I am no longer a commercial fisherman, but a subsistence fisherman of 30 years in the Bering Sea. We are seeing our fish stocks drop radically in recent years, and are seeing our waters warming. _x000D_\n3.How can our rural and Native Alaskan people have direct input to your process???

    "Comment": "Engaging fishing communities in CMSP_x000D_\n_x000D_\nCommercial and recreational fisheries are important existing uses of coastal and deep-water marine environments.  Fishermen are a significant subset of citizenry with direct stakeholder dependence on the quality and effectiveness of CMSP.  Trends suggest that fisheries, if managed to their potential, will become a more pervasive and valuable industry in marine environments as time goes on, and that more citizens will count themselves as fishermen.  For this to happen, the cumulative environmental footprint of fisheries must be managed aggressively at the same time that environmental quality supporting fisheries is maintained._x000D_\n_x000D_\nFishery management is often contentious.  Allocation and access issues should rightfully center on state and federal fishery management processes that have evolved to address these issues.  CMSP should fully integrate these existing state and federal fishery management bodies in such a way that the basic political functions that these bodies perform (i.e., allocation of access, mitigation of impacts, etc) remain intact.  State agencies, NOAA Fisheries and Regional Fishery Management Councils should be represented on steering committees in the architecture of CMSP._x000D_\n_x000D_\nNevertheless, it should be recognized that these state and federal fishery management bodies do not, necessarily, represent the \u201cpolitical center\u201d of commercial and recreational fishing communities.  To engage fishermen constructively, to foster understanding of and support for CMSP, requires outreach at a \u201cgrass roots\u201d level.  Fishing communities are not homogeneous, CMSP issues vary significantly from one locality to the next, and \u201copinion leaders\u201d deeply embedded in these communities are not always obvious.  Outreach should begin early in CMSP and should initially focus on elevating the planning skills and knowledge of CMSP process resident in coastal communities.   This can be done a as a curriculum offered through community colleges, or marketed directly to municipal planners, engaged citizens and user groups._x000D_\n_x000D_\nJohn Williamson runs a charter vessel in southern Maine and has served on the New England Fishery Management Council and the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary Advisory Council._x000D_",

    "Comment": "The Environmental Law Institute (ELI) submits this comment, highlighting key challenges and opportunities for the legal aspects of implementing coastal and marine spatial planning (CMSP). Our conclusions result from four years of law and policy research into ecosystem-based approaches for ocean management, including CMSP._x000D_\n_x000D_\n_x000D_\n1.\tEXISTING FEDERAL LAWS CAN SUPPORT AN EFFECTIVE CMSP APPROACH THAT INTEGRATES SECTOR-SPECIFIC MANAGEMENT, MINIMIZES CUMULATIVE IMPACTS WITHIN AND BETWEEN SECTORS, AND FOSTERS RATIONAL TRADE-OFF DECISIONS._x000D_\n_x000D_\nCMSP must overcome existing single-sector limitations, including the inability of current approaches to account for the cumulative effects of all activities or to make rational trade-off decisions about competing ocean and coastal uses. Two major statutes are available to address these challenges: the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). ELI\u2019s research demonstrates that both laws could be applied as written to support a CMSP framework. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nNEPA already mandates analysis of reasonably foreseeable cumulative impacts as part of its environmental assessment requirements. A marine spatial plan and underlying ecosystem assessment could serve as a platform upon which to develop cumulative impact assessments, determine the legal threshold of \u201csignificance,\u201d and create mitigation measures to minimize predicted impacts._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThe CZMA creates a federal-state partnership for coordinated management of multiple coastal uses. It provides a vehicle for establishing CMSP in state waters and linking it to federal waters. Rhode Island, for example, is using the Act\u2019s \u201cspecial area management plan\u201d provisions to support development of a marine spatial plan.  In Massachusetts, a new state law requires marine spatial planning, and the resulting plan will become part of the state\u2019s \u201cenforceable coastal zone policies\u201d under the CZMA.  Such an approach could be taken at the regional level, and a properly crafted regional plan likewise could become an enforceable coastal zone policy under the CZMA._x000D_\n_x000D_\n_x000D_\n2.\tTHE EXISTING LEGAL FRAMEWORK PROVIDES SOME SPECIFIC TOOLS THAT CAN BE USED TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT CMSP, INCLUDING PLACE-BASED DESIGNATIONS, PROVISIONS FOR RESTRICTING ACTIVITIES, CONSULTATION REQUIREMENTS, AND PERMITTING AND LICENSING PROCEDURES._x000D_\n_x000D_\nCurrent regional ocean governance initiatives often lack a clear legal mandate or authority to achieve region-wide objectives. Instead the participating institutions must continue to look to sector-based laws, regulations, and policies to provide the basis for regional governance programs. While this demonstrates the flexibility of the legal framework and the discretion that agencies have to undertake regional governance, it can also lead to conflicting objectives, lack of incentive, or inability to implement ecosystem-based regional plans._x000D_\n_x000D_\nIn designing a CMSP process, especially in the absence of new legislation, ELI encourages the explicit incorporation of and reference to existing legal provisions that support CMSP decision-making. This recommendation could be implemented in several different ways, including a national approach that takes the form of an executive order or a national or regional approach that utilizes compacts or memoranda of understanding to establish explicit linkages. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nCreating explicit linkages and legal authorities could bolster agencies\u2019 ability to implement CMSP in accordance with existing mandates. This could include, for example, using place-based designation laws to codify CMSP area designations, or using a coastal marine plan to satisfy planning requirements._x000D_\n_x000D_\nSome statutes specifically encourage optimizing sector-specific activities, which in the absence of proper guidance or legal interpretations could be viewed as a limitation on agencies\u2019 discretion to implement supposedly \u201cunrelated\u201d CMSP goals. However, even within such sector-specific laws, there are often requirements to properly consider the welfare of the ecosystem and society. A CMSP process could be developed that addresses these more general requirements, so that subsequent agency decisions that adhere to the coastal and marine spatial plan would satisfy both the sector-specific mandate and the plan\u2019s broader goals._x000D_\n_x000D_\nEXISTING U.S. LAWS WERE NOT CONCEIVED WITH CMSP IN MIND, BUT THEY CAN BE IMPLEMENTED TO SUPPORT IT.  IN THE ABSENCE OF A NEW CMSP LEGAL MANDATE, THE SUCCESS OF CMSP WILL DEPEND ON HOW WELL THOSE IN CHARGE CAN CAPITALIZE ON THE STRENGTHS OF CURRENT LAW AND NAVIGATE ITS SHORTCOMINGS.  _x000D_\n_x000D_\n_x000D_\n_x000D_\nFor more information, visit http://www.eli.org/Program_Areas/ocean_pubs.cfm to download the following ELI Research Reports: _x000D_\n_x000D_\nMARINE SPATIAL PLANNING IN U.S. WATERS: AN ASSESSMENT AND ANALYSIS OF EXISTING LEGAL MECHANISMS, ANTICIPATED BARRIERS, AND FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES (2009)_x000D_\n_x000D_\nOCEAN AND COASTAL ECOSYSTEM BASED MANAGEMENT: IMPLEMENTATION HANDBOOK (2009)_x000D_\n_x000D_\nHard copies are available upon request._x000D_",

Protecting, maintaining, and restoring ecosystem health should be made a priority. Issues like dead zones, unsustainable fishing, short-sighted oil and gas development, and the destruction of coastal wetlands threaten all of us who value it and rely on its resources. We need a national ocean policy that will require coordinated management that addresses multiple issues at the same time._x000D_\n_x000D_\n    Finally, please build on the Task Force's important work by issuing an Executive Order to protect, maintain, and restore the health of ocean ecosystems and advance CMSP. Such an action would make great strides toward leaving a blue legacy._x000D_",

    "Comment": "I am Jack Brooks, and along with my brothers and son, we own and operate The J.M. Clayton Company, a crab processor on the eastern shore of Maryland.  We have been in business since 1890 and our business spans five generations of proud Americans in my family who have been providing food to the American people. _x000D_\nWe are in the crab business, and like the others in our industry, we produce healthy, chemical additive free food for the people of the United States.  Only the domestic blue crab industry can make this claim, and without us your alternatives you would be left only with crabmeat from several parts of the world.  Some who import crabmeat have already been known to import a variety of species, already often mislabeled as blue crab, which have had any number of chemicals added to the processing of the meat that Americans are unknowingly consuming when they buy meat that is imported into our country. Our domestic crab industry remains a part of critical network of companies who produce healthy, high quality food for the nation and at the same time ensure the continued employment of many coastal fishermen, often from rural areas where alternative employment is scarce or non-existent. _x000D_\nOnly with the continued viability of a domestic crab industry will a supply of safe and healthy seafood supply be guaranteed. _x000D_\nIn order for our industry to survive we need numerous factors to be in place, several of which are within the sphere of a Marine Spatial Planning system that would be put in place. A couple of these items include:_x000D_\n1.\tPlanning should be coordinated in ways that protect the water quality and habitat \u2013 particularly nursery habitat \u2013 that are necessary for all stages of the blue crab.  In order to do this an effective Marine Spatial Planning system MUST examine, coordinate and at times control land-based activities.  In your report, item \u201cVIII. Geographic Scope of Coastal and Marine Spatial Planning\u201d states  \u201c  Your current proposal to avoid on-land spatial planning issues is in direct conflict with your highlighted goal to place \u201cScience-Based Information at the Heart of Decision-Making.\u201d Anyone with even the most minimal understanding of how coasts and estuaries function understands that the land and the water are inextricably connected. A system that examines the impacts and activities of multiple business and governmental functions in a spatial and temporal way to maximize benefits to the nation must look at the land to water interface.  Any system that proposed to protect critical national resources, such as nursery habitat, that ignores the scientific knowledge that draws clear connections between the land and water is doomed to be ineffective and should be scrapped, with the authors of a Marine Spatial Planning system going back to the drawing board until this shortfall is addressed. While we do note that you are allowing permission to look at other areas \u201cAdditional inland areas may be included in the planning area as the regional planning bodies, described in Section IX below, deem appropriate \u201d we believe that a national policy document that leaves the connection between land-water interface as an optional activity of any Marine Spatial Planning system is significantly flawed. _x000D_\n2.\tImpacts on the harvesting community \u2013 the working watermen from Texas through Maryland who work to collect the live crabs that we process, must be minimized. This means access to fishing grounds in a spatial and temporal sense that allows them to collect crabs in a way that maximizes efficiency. Being zoned out of commercially important waters, or suffering time delays from rolling closures (large areas closed for LNG shipments, for instance) during crucial harvest times can have a significant and rippling effect in our industry.  For management reasons, in many coastal areas there are already times of year that restrict fishing activity, and additional closure times could have an unplanned and uncoordinated effect on the industry. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nOne of the hallmarks of the new Marine Spatial Planning system that you propose to create \u201cbrings Federal, State, and Tribal Partners Together in an Unprecedented Manner to Jointly Plan for the Future. \u201d  While these is a scant mention of other groups being involved in the process, it is not clear which groups will get an official seat at the table, and even if they are a part of the discussions, how the decision making process will occur.  In our direct experience, we are not, in the overwhelming number of cases, well represented by federal or state agency representatives. They rarely understand, and at times are for sheer political reasons, are at odds with our business interests and the interests of the American people who consume the high quality food we produce. While we remain hopeful that our agency career and elected officials will someday better understand, and therefore more appropriately and accurately represent our industry, at this time, and we fear that for at least the immediate future we must have a mechanism to also represent our own interests in any Marine Spatial Planning system that is established. _x000D_\nThe system you propose engages both a national and a regional structure. How our industry would be represented, if at all, at either level is not sufficiently specified in your Interim Framework.  Further, it is not apparent how issues that span multiple regions would be addressed......(please see attached file for our full comments) ",
